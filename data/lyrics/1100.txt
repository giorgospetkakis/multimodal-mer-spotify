[Verse 1: Donald Fagen]
A world become one of salads and sun
Only a fool would say that
A boy with a plan, a natural man
Wearing a white Stetson hat

[Pre-Chorus: Donald Fagen]
Unhand that gun begone
There's no one to fire upon
If he's holding it high
He's telling a lie

[Chorus: Donald Fagen]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that

[Verse 2: Donald Fagen]
The man in the street dragging his feet
Don't wanna hear the bad news
Imagine your face there at his place
Standing inside his brown shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Donald Fagen]
You do his nine to five
Drag yourself home half alive
And there on the screen
A man with a dream

[Chorus: Donald Fagen]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that

[Bridge: Donald Fagen]
Anybody on the street has murder in his eyes
You feel no pain
And you're younger than you realize

[Chorus - abbreviated: Donald Fagen]
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool

[Guitar solo: Jeff "Skunk Baxter]

[Chorus: Donald Fagen]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
