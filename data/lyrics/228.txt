[Chorus]
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember

Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember

[Verse 1]
In time, I rope you in again
I try and burn you back through him
I built a tower in my bones
I spill the mortar through my home

[Chorus]
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember him
I don't remember

[Verse 2]
Don't let your heartbeat keep you safe
No telling what keeps me awake
One hundred fingerprints I hear
A hundred linger in my ear

[Chorus]
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember

[Outro]
Measure fortune, killing time
Measure fortune, killing time
Measure fortune, killing time
