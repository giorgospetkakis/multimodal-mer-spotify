[Verse 1]
It’s late
Time for bed
So I sit and I wait
For that gin and tonic
To go to your head

[Verse 2]
I know
It’s a devious plan
But it’s the only way that I know
To get those big bad car keys
Out of your hand

[Chorus]
You know
That I remain a gentleman
But even so
There’s only so much
A gentleman can stand
Sleep with me
Oh
Sleep with me, tonight

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
My cards are on your table
My dreams are in your bed
Oh, if I was able
I’d be there instead

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, sleep with me tonight

[Instrumental]
