[Intro]
Put your sneakers on
Put your sneakers on
We're goin' dancin' all night long

[Verse 1]
I've got somewhere to be
I want you to come with me
See, I've put my sneakers on
'Cause I'm gonna keep dancin' after they all go home

[Pre-Chorus]
So are you ready?
Did you eat?
Do you have the energy? (Energy)
Are you reloaded?
Are you able to stay on your feet? (On your feet)
Don't want you passing out
After a couple hours of beats (Oh, no)
We're keep going, and going, and going, yeah, 'cause

[Chorus 1]
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
All you gotta do is take a chance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

[Verse 2]
So now, they're closing
(Close it up, shut it down, go home now)
But this far from the end
(Second round, ding, it's about to begin)
'Cause I got comfortable footwear
The weather is nice, so let's take it outside
Just need some hand claps
And the beatbox, and it's alright

[Chorus 2]
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Don't you even worry about other plans
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

[Bridge]
When the sun goes down (The sun goes down)
When we wake up (We wake up)
A good night's sleep, ha, no need
No problem staying awake (Oh, no)
When the beat is like an earthquake
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And we're unstoppable
We're uncontrollable
Just admit it, you can't stop it
It's addictive, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Breakdown]
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

[Chorus 2]
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Basically, what we're gonna do is dance

Basically, what we're gonna do is dance
Don't you even worry about other plans
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight
