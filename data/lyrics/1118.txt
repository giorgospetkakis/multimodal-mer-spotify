[Verse 1]
Frankie Teardrop
Twenty year old Frankie
He's married, he's got a kid
And he's working in a factory
He's working from seven to five
He's just trying to survive

[Refrain]
Well let's hear it for Frankie
Frankie, Frankie

[Verse 2]
Well Frankie can't make it
Cause things are just too hard
Frankie can't make enough money
Frankie can't buy enough food
And Frankie's getting evicted

[Refrain]
Oh, let's hear it for Frankie
Oh, Frankie, Frankie
Oh, Frankie, Frankie

[Verse 3]
Frankie is so desperate
He's gonna kill his wife and kids
Frankie's gonna kill his kid
Frankie picked up a gun
Pointed at the six month old in the crib
Oh, Frankie
AHHHHHH!
Frankie looked at his wife
Shot her
Ah
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
Ughhh, uughhh
"Oh what have I done?!"

[Refrain]
Let's hear it for Frankie
Frankie Teardrop

[Verse 4]
Frankie put the gun to his head, mmm
Uhh, uhh
Aah, hmm
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Mmm, Frankie's dead
Aaaaaaaaah, aaah, aaaaaah, mmm, aaaaaah
Ooh, Frankie

[Verse 5]
Aahh, ahh, aah
Frankie's lying in hell
Ahh, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Come on, get up
We're all Frankies
We're all lying in hell
Come on, get up, come on
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
