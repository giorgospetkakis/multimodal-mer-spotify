I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, t-t-try, try
I can't get no, I can't get me no

When I'm ridin' in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, uh no, no, no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no girly action
And I try, and I try, and I try, t-t-try, try
I can't get no, I can't get me no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts could me
But he can't be a man cause he does not smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, uh no, no, no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

And when I'm flyin' around the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' do that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Tells me baby, baby, baby, baby, better come back later next week
Can't you see I'm on a losin' streak

I can't get no, uh no, no, no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no satisfaction

No, no, no, I can't get no satisfaction
No, no, no, I can't get me no satisfaction
No, no, no, no, no, no satisfaction
No, no, no, no, no, no satisfaction

No, no, no, no, no, no satisfaction
No, no, no, I can't get me no satisfaction
Girl, I can't get no satisfaction
