Sitting in my boxers, eating Apple Jacks
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Wacking it to late night Cinemax
Welcome to my world
JÃ¤germeister and Captain Crunch
Nicotine and The Brady Bunch
Building a boat outta pudding cups
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Non-stop no girl action without you

This old shirt is starting to stink
I don't give a damn what people think
I can take a leak in the kitchen sink
Welcome to my world
No you needn't shed a tear
'Cause I've got waffles, and I've got beer
And I've got Mr. Belvedere
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Non-stop no girl action without you, oh yeah

Don't wanna be here, don't wanna be here tonight
Can't stand another episode of Cheers tonight
I hate that Woody, I hate Diane
Frasier and Norman, that dumbass mailman
