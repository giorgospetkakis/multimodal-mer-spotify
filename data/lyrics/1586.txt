[Verse 1]
Leaders come
Stand in line
Reveal your true self and conform
I sold my song
Crossed the borderline
I found something I'd never adjust to

[Chorus]
Come here
I've paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here
I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you
Do you

[Verse 2]
Carbon soul
Transparent and played out
See you soon in non-fiction
I sold my song
My mouth was sewn
But it's coming undone and that's why I sold out

[Chorus]
Come here
I've paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here
I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you
Do you
