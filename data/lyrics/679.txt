[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
I get up around seven
Get out of bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothing, no
Because worrying's a waste of my (fucking) time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone

[Outro]
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I leave it allâ€“behind
Yowsa!
