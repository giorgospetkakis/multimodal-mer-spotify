In my heart sent
My confession, my condolence
You're indefinite
You're incompetent, inconsiderate
You're so childish
I will push you
Out of what is real, out of my head
You can stick and drown
At your residence of disappointments
Are of yours to come
So embrace them
Oh, my shallow one, today

If I could change anything
Then I would change everything
These bitter days shall remain

I don't ask for your forgiveness
I don't care much for your actress
That's just you, though
Shallow and selfish
So, I go now
Oh, my hollow one, today

If I could change anything
Then I would change everything
These bitter days shall remain

You carry your blues behind your eyes
Don't flatter yourself, I will survive
So carry your blues, your own denial
Your feathers are gone, you'll never fly

If I could change anything
Then I would wipe the years away
If I could change anything
Then I would brush the time away
If I could change anything
Then I would change everything
These bitter days shall remain

Since you're gone, I'm much better than you
You carry your blues behind your eyes
Don't flatter yourself I will survive
So carry your blues, your own denial
Your feathers are gone you'll never fly
She'll never fly
