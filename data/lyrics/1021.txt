Receive me - unleash me

I crave the morning quickly come
I get down on my knees and pray
And hope the dawning pulls me right out (right out) of my dream

You walk right by my window
Everyday I can feel you so near
When will you come to get me out (get me out) of my fear

Would you unind me? If you'd finally find me

I am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound
Would you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out? Pull me out!

Each day a new tomorrow
And I long for the same old aim
I'm bound in bitter sorrow - I know, I want out, but I can't

Would you unleash me? If you'd perceive me

I am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound
Would you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out?

I am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound
Would you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out? Pull me out!

Get me out - please hear my prayer
Do you think it'll go that way?
I get down on my knees and pray
Do you think it'll go that way?
I get down on my knees and pray

I am tied to the ground. Get me out just to dry my tears
Ready to be unbound
Yes I pray

Would you break me out and
Would you help me to get out get out?
Pull me out!
