She feels like,
A stranger has come in the night,
And stolen her life,
And left her with this.

And boughs break on ebony toothaches;
She's just a flask trapped inside a fall.

I know you need to find what you thought you left behind in a past life;
I won't question why the only light that you have you give away.
I know you need to find what you thought you left behind in a past life;
I won't question why the only light that you have you give away.

She feels like,
A stranger has come in the night,
And stolen her life,
And left her with this.
