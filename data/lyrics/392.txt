[Verse 1]
I wanna start it over
I wanna start again
I want a new beginning
One without an end
I feel it inside
Calling out to me

[Chorus]
It's a voice that whispers my name
It's a kiss without any shame
Something beautiful, yeah, yeah
Like a song that stirs in my head
Singing love will take us where
Something's beautiful

[Verse 2]
I've heard it in the silence
Seen it on a face
I've felt it in the long hour
Like a sweet embrace
I know this is true
It's calling out to me

[Chorus]
It's a voice that whispers my name
It's a kiss without any shame
Something beautiful, yeah, yeah
Like a song that stirs in my head
Singing love will take us where
Something's beautiful

[Bridge]
It's the child on her wedding day
It's the daddy that gives her away
Something beautiful, yeah, yeah
When we laugh so hard we cry
Oh the love between you and I
Something beautiful

[Chorus]
It's a voice that whispers my name
It's a kiss without any shame
Something beautiful, yeah, yeah
Like a song that stirs in my head
Singing love will take us where
Something's beautiful

[Chorus]
It's the child on her wedding day
It's the daddy that gives her away
Something beautiful
When we laugh so hard we cry
It's the love between You and I
Something beautiful

[Outro]
Something beautiful
