[Verse 1]
Look into to the mirror
From the other side
Seeing no reflection
And it blows my mind
Trying to deny it
But the damage is done
I'll just run as always
But the race is run

[Chorus]
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

[Verse 2]
Read the daily fiction, Superman is dead
Crushing coins of silver, imitating lead
Then if you will fix the children of the past
I guess their's isn't welcome, doesn't time move fast

[Chorus]
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

[Verse 3]
Night in the shadow of man
This is the dawn of the dead
Don't let it live in your head
And then now as the sabbath begins
It wakes your nightmare again
So run away if you can
So just run
Run as fast as you can

[Chorus]
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out

[Outro]
Too late too tell me it's over now
Falling apart at the seams
No angel sits on my shoulders now
I hold my head and it screams
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out
