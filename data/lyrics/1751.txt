[Chorus]
Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning
Children of the night - can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling
Listen to their beats - can you hear them hollering?

Start in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Groove like you need it
Dancing it up 'til the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Free your mind 'cause tonight we're gonna break it down
Shake it, make it funky down
Get so high as the toxins in your body
Are the bass and the drums and the roar, roar, roar
We're right on time, and all is fine
If you've lost your senses, here have mine
And lose yourself from the time you awake
'Til the evening time
'Til the sunshine breaks

[Chorus]
Ah, come on!
Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning
Children of the night - can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling
Listen to their beats - can you hear them hollering?

Start in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Groove like you need it
Dancing it up 'til the sun goes down
'Til the sun goes down…

[Verse 2]
Welcome all to the amazing, the hysteria
Are ya feelin' what we bring to y'all?
Peace and love
And you're all getting low tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Fire is burning on and there's children in the forest playing
Just come forget this too
Forget because the beast is hunting for its prey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, yeah

[Bridge]
'Til the sun goes down
'Til the sun goes
Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down, sun goes down

[Chorus & Outro]
Open your eyes 'cause another day is dawning
Children of the night - can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and an angel starts falling
Listen to their beats - can you hear them hollering?

Start in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Groove like you need it
Dancing it up 'til the sun goes down
'Til the sun goes down…

Goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Yeah! Ha!

Start in the morning, through to the evening
Dance like you're the only one around
Move like you want it
Groove like you need it
Dancing it up 'til the sun goes down

Yeah! Yeah!
'Til the sun goes down
'Til the sun goes down
'Til the sun goes down
