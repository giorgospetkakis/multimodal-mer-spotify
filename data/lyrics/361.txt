(T. Donelly)

I'm keeping you I'm keeping you
I'm keeping you so realize your fate
I'm keeping you I'm keeping you
I'm keeping you so settle down now

You landed here from inner space
You landed with that screwed-up look on your face
I wanted you from way back when
I wanted you for years, then years again

I'm keeping you I'm keeping you
I'm keeping you so settle in now

My return to wildlife by satellite
By beautiful moon-shining girl
Whether by hard ground or splashdown
We're safely back in the world

My heart's not new
I'm not like you
I've loved and been loved well and badly too
My body's been through everything
I've used and been used
I got over it
There's something that you learn on a tightrope
Just outside the spotlight there's a big net waiting for...

My return to wildlife by satellite
By beautiful moon-shining girl
Whether by hard ground or splashdown
We're safely back in the world

I'm keeping you
