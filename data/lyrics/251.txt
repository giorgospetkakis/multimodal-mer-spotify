You sit around wishing for forever and a day, but only made it halfway through
Wishing is for children and the games they play, who never thought it through

Whatever happened to the stars that were in his eyes, the way they lit my soul before?
You can return those stars back to the skies, the world needs them more

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back
But when the world was cold and black, you got by, and you survived

They say it gets easier at the end of everyday, so why do I wake up with tears?
You can turn a phrase 10million ways, and still it won't be true

Love is gravity with a pull that you can't deny, thats why you're always falling
But when you hit the ground you can't stay down, your life is calling

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back
But when the world was cold and black, you got by, and you survived

But when the ust is gone from the atomic bomb, you can smile
And when the air is clear, you'll know the end us near, almost whole again
