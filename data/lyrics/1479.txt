[Verse 1]
I'm being dragged down, down by the hand
The hand of a golden giant man
He's crushing my knuckles and splitting my skin
He says he'll let go, if only I'd ask it of him
He says, "Girl, it's your call
You wanna fly? You wanna fall?"
So I shout, "Oh, I wanna get away from you
As fast as I can"
I tell my feet to move it
I hope they have a plan

[Chorus]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today

[Verse 2]
So now I'm free, free
From the big bad giant
Who was stalking me
Thank you feet, for guiding me, yeah
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least

[Chorus]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today

[Bridge]
Sometimes I'm tempted, sometimes I am
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man
Oh, he was the line between pleasure and pain
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

[Chorus]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today

[Outro]
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
