Take the velvet line for comfort
High above the water, feel disconnected and free
Tired of hopes that I just can't run from
I travel in secret, I know they're pursuing me

Morning that falls represents a weak link
After is after night's work is done
There's no sun, just a grey horizon
Hiding from heaven another frozen world

Watch the ship hold to its course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm lost at sea
Going through the motions

Gave all my passion to the ocean
She holds it for me in reserve
My word is gone into remission
Your love's a tragedy that I don't deserve

She said, "You're only growing now."
She said, "Soon have we begun, then she can have you
But until then, you're mine."

I watch her hold to her course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm riding high
Going through

Seems like every flash in her eye's
An act of devotion
And me I'm lost in her hands
Going through the motions

Shore far away off the port side
Shore far away off the bow
Shore far away off the starboard side
Shore far away from now
