Why can't you be with me
Watching American TV
We'll order in chinese
And ask the world to stay away, please

These hotels groe so stale
Telling the same ass-tale
By the time I get to you
I'll be too tired to...

Chourus:
Soak up some lazy days
No one can rain on our parade
Standing here beneath the shade
Of our love

Let's slide down the avenue
Like good New Yorkers do
Maybe then I'll believe
When you give, man, you recieve

Chourus

Wide-eyed and stupid
I'm waiting for the arrows of cupid
Wide-eyed and stupid
I'm waiting for the arrows of cupid
Wide-eyed and stupid
I'm waiting for the arrows
Of your love
