If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you, I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy say, "It's a shame, it's a downright disgrace"
Long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say

My friends tell you there's no future in loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want to, I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children depending on me too?
And am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got somebody else at home, who needs me just as much?

Am I wrong, give my love to a married man?
And am I wrong tryin' to hold on to the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong, give my love to a married man?
Tell me, am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping at night
I don't wanna be right
