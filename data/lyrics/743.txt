[Verse 1]
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

[Verse 2]
Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

[Verse 3]
I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight

[Outro]
Stop trying to figure it out
(you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be
The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme
For "heavier things"
