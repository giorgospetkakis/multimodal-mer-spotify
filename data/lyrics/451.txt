He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
Don't judge a book by its cover
'cause he's got the face of an angel but
There's a devil in his eye!
He's such a delicate thing but when he's starting to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit he's nothing at all
But in a Morris chair, you'd be surprised
He doesn't say very much but when he's starting to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brains
But in a taxi cab, and when he starts to grab
I say in a taxi cab, you'd be surprised
This one's a real danger!
