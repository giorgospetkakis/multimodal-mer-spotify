[Chorus]
If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers

[Verse 1]
We want a revolution and we’re baying for your blood
We’re laying down the law, and your name’s mud
You’d like to be a member of the human race
You want to be a good boy, but you couldn’t stand the taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame Simon because he said
You’ve got two lives down and one life left
Blame Simon because he said
You could think better with a hole in your head
You could think better with a hole in your head

[Chorus]
If we catch a criminal (If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal (If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers

[Verse 2]
Got your revolution, now you're waging war again
Marching on the spot when you should have made amends
'Cause you say you fight for us, cross your heart and hope to die
You’re the bully in the playground, and we’ll hang you out to dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame Simon because he said
You’ve got two lives down and one life left
Blame Simon because he said
You could think better with a hole in your head
You could think better with a hole in your head

[Chorus]
If we catch a criminal
(If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
(If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
(When we catch a criminal)
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
(If we catch a criminal)

[Bridge]
Line them up against a wall and shoot them all
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
If we catch a criminal
(If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
(When we catch a criminal)
There’s nothing we can do
Play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
(If we catch a criminal)
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
(Nothing we)
Play cops and robbers

[Outro]
If we catch a criminal
There’s nothing you or I can do
Line them up against a wall
I’ll get a gun and shoot them all
