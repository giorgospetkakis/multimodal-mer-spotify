[Intro: Paul Stanley]
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun
Got you under their thumb
Hit it!

[Verse 1: Peter Criss]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

[Verse 2: Peter Criss]
Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothing that you can do, no, no

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

[Verse 1: Peter Criss]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond, yeah
Whoo, black diamond

[Instrumental outro 2:28-5:12]
