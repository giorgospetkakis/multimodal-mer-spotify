[Intro]
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun (Ohh-ohh-ohh)
Got you under their thumb
Hit it!

[Verse 1]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

[Verse 2]
Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too (Ohh-ohh-ohh)
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothing that you can do, no no

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

[Instrumental break 1:34-2:02]

[Verse 3]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond, yeah
Whoo, black diamond

[Instrumental outro 2:28-5:12]
