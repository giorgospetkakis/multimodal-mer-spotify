[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing

Go down go down go down go downtown
Go down go down go down go down

[Verse 1]
Your face never saw the sights, the bright lights
The walls that always invite
Get it right, no fright
You'll be there up all night
I'll give you a bus ride, a park slide
A high rise full of surprise
A smooth path, follow track
All the way to my flat

[Pre-Chorus]
Come with me come with me come with me come with me there

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown

[Verse 2]
Went to your area and I thought I would bury ya
Touched a monolith and it caused a hysteria
You keep on pinin' for me to go dinin'
I had me a meal and that keep me belly from whinin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Come with me come with me come with me come with me there

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna take you down town
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you down town
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you down town

Go down go down go down go down town
Go down go down go down go down town
Go down go down go down go down town
Go down go down go down go down town

[Bridge]
Caves for bravin' (go down)
Flags for wavin' (go down)
Clubs for ravin' (go down)
Roads for pavin' (downtown)
Rivers for sailin' (go down)
Stores unveilin' (go down)
Walls for scalin' (go down)
Temples for wailin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna take you downtown (downtown)
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown (downtown)
Show you my thing, show you my thing

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
