We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and winding road
Look on the map, I think we've been here before
Close up the doors, let's roll once more
Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror, is he still followin' me?
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll
Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Move out, boys, and let's get ready to race
454's coming over the hill
The man on patrol's going to give us a bill
Time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movin' if we're going to make a buck
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll
Roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll, roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll, roll
