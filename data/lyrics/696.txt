When future is present
And past is gone
Now is shallow
Nothing is big
So that I can't see

When past is present
And future goes
Now is foggy
And past is pink
So that I look back

Now is future
And past is gone
Now is nothing
Future is great
So that I can see

Will I see even if the day's are getting short?
Will I see even if the day's are getting shorter?
Will I see?

When future is now
And past is past
Nothing is shadow or fog or nothing
So that I see everything

Will I see even if the day's are getting short?
Will I see even if the day's are getting shorter?
Will I see?
