I'm a mess
I guess
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened
But once again something's happened
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus

Waiting for the rain to stop
Destination: beautiful
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
Someday will come back to us
If you're willing let it go
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
But some say we're headed for destruction

I'll ask you
What in the world should we do?
The light is green our break is through
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard?
Well, you know I never want to miss
I hold on tight and reminisce
But it's bittersweet to me
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me
But I'm the one who keeps on reading...reading
But I'm the one who wants to let it go
I'm the first to speak
You're the last to know
Another scene that we're creating
I need to know if we're still making useless ruckus

Waiting for the rain to stop
Destination: beautiful
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
Someday will come back to us
If you're willing let it go
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
But some say we're headed for destruction

Waiting for the rain to stop
Destination: beautiful
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
Someday will come back to us
If you're willing let it go
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
But some say we're headed for destruction
