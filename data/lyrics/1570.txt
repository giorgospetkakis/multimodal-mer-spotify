You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
The two drunk kids, trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float

And eventually the sky did return
And I was there outside in green
And I watched the world being reborn 'til 1 AM
So I thought I'd let you know
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love, just like blood will always stain

And if I could reverse it
I don't think that it'd be worth it
Because I know in my heart
I would never let you tumble to the ground

No, I'd never let you fall
No, I'd never let you fall
No, I'd never let you fall
