You have always been so good to me
Until recently
What's happening to you baby?
You don't seem to care about anything
Absolutely nothing, are even listening?

And oh, baby, please open your heart
Or lack of love will tear us apart

I feel low and I need your caress
But you couldn't care less
When did you become so careless?

Tell me, what's going on in your head?
Was it something I said?
Are your feelings for me dead?

And oh, baby, please open your heart
Or lack of love will tear us apart

I've got something on my mind
You are truly one of a kind
So you see, I know I'll never find
Someone to replace you
Let’s not split up in two
Let’s help each other through
And baby, for a start, please open your heart

And oh, baby, please open your heart
Or lack of love will tear us apart
And oh, baby, please open your heart
