Looking out the window
It's beautiful out there
Give me reasons to remeber
Summer trees are stripped and almost bare
It's late september
Call the sun to kiss it better
Thank God for understanding

It seemed that we were on the youth
It looked like you were under fire
And all the love was never true
The more that we refused to fight
It seemed that I was never right
Walking another sleepless dream
And now everything I leave behind
I leave for you

Look into the mirror, what am I?
A frightened creature locked inside
My mother's hair, my father's eyes
Memories, time rearranged for you
Is everything changed for you?
Do they make it better?
Thank God for understanding

It seemed that we were on the youth
It looked like you were under fire
It seemed that love was never true
The more that we refused to fight
I know that I was never right
Walking another sleepless dream
And everything I leave behind
I leave for you
