I was cleaning the ash from the fire
And putting the party away
Helping out all of my lost friends
To see the light of day

I'm feeling the wind through the window
Sometimes you crash through the wall
Seems like it comes out of nowhere
There's no warning at all

Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs high
Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs dry

I was making my way through a movie
And finding it hard to decide
Sometimes it comes without warning
It turns me over inside

I'm making a stab in the darkness
But you're wearing a hole in the floor
Suddenly everything changes
You're not the same as before

Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs high
Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs dry

You danced in my dream in a white dress
I watched from the top of the stairs
I woke up looking to find you
But you were not there

Seventeen hours of driving
But that's not a surprise
The world's all heavy with traffic
We never were good at goodbyes

No we never were no good at goodbyes
