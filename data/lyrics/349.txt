Don't bother going to class
'Cause nobody cares if you cut
And it's not smart to experiment
With Bengay on your nuts

If you ask her out and she says maybe
What she really means is "no way"
And if you try jerking off behind the back-stop
The team will be playing that day
(Oh-god)

These are the things I wish I knew
These are the things I wish I knew in high school
Yeah, these are the things I wish I knew in high school

Don't call the head jock a fag
Even if it's true
And don't hold out for that one special girl
'Cause she'll never have sex with you
(No way)

These are the things I wish I knew
These are the things I wish I knew in high school
Yeah, these are the things I wish I knew in high school

Dont let 'em see ya crying
No matter how it hurts
And nobody ever got laid
'Cause they were wearing a Rush tee shirt
(No)

These are the things I wish I knew
(I wish I knew)
These are the things I wish I knew in high school
(The things I wish I knew)
Yeah
These are the things I wish I knew in high school
