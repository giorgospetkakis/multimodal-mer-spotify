Polite to say that I drifted away
And I never thought I'd care
Along the way I've made mistakes
But I made them over there
If I told you twice I'd be
What you never thought i'd be
If I told you I survived
In your pig society

You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what lies inside
And you never want to see

Locked away in a cage today
So I'm doin' what I can
Take these fuckin' chains off me
And I'll show you what I am

You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what I've survived
And you never would beleive

Sick of politicians and politics and prisons
Lyin' and runnin' my life
You pathetic preacher and hypocritic leaders
Smilin' and wastin' my time, yeah

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you

Survive the hate of this fuckin' place
And I'll call you when I can
Some snitch fucker died last night
Do you think I give a damn?

You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what it's like inside
And you never want to see

Sick of politicians and politics and prisons
Lyin' and runnin' my life
You pathetic preacher and hypocritic leaders
Smilin'and wastin' my time
Sick of your religions and full of shit opinions
I'm tired of waiting to die
Run me in - I'll do it all again
Motherfucker I'm still alive
