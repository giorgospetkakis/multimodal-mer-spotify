[Verse 1]
Little bird, little bird, little bird what d'ya hear?
The clink of morning cheers
Orange juice, concentrate
Crossword puzzles start to grate
One across
4 letter word it's just not sitting

[Verse 2]
Little bird, little bird, little bird what do you see?
A picture perfect scene
Two tone lawns are manicured
The garden's wearing haute couture
It's hiding something
It's trying too hard
Hiding something
It's trying too hard

[Verse 3]
Little bird, little bird, little bird where are they now?
Daytime TV, lounge
A carriage clock, a mantelpiece
A family wiped up J-cloth cleaned
Unsaid, festers
In the throws of the sofa

[Verse 4]
Little bird, little bird, little bird how are you feeling?
Like help in quarantine
Pearly whites, touchdown smile
Absent creases round the eyes
Tell tale, hard sell, we smell rats in the kitchen
Tell tale, hard sell, we smell rats in the kitchen

[Verse 5]
Little bird, little bird, little bird what can we do?
Think tank, think rescue
Simon says, "Etch-a-Sketch"
Some encoded message only he would get
Quickly now
Cause this is not how it ends!

[Bridge]
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Well I've got one more question
And I swear I'll let it rest
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Well I've just one more question
And I swear I'll let it rest

[Breakdown]
One more question
Mmm, I'll let it rest
Mmm, I swear I'll let it rest
Got one more question
Got one more question

[Outro]
Little bird, little bird, little bird where have you gone?
