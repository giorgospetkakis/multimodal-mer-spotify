[Verse 1]
Utopia, lost in chaos
As the sky turns black
Suicide legacy
There is no turning back
(No turning back)

[Chorus]
Retribution answers cold
Moving in for the kill
Deep hideous festering
Bestial epidemic, repulsive need

[Hook]
Control, control

[Verse 2]
Suicide nation
Mass-appeal, death-addiction
Dead but dreaming
Restrained by phobia, brainwashed into submission

[Hook]
Control, control

[Bridge]
Suicide
Jaws locked around your spine
(Locked around your spine)

[Unsung lyrics]
"The face of evil is always the face of total need"

[Chorus]
Retribution answers cold
Moving in for the kill
Deep hideous festering
Bestial epidemic, repulsive need

[Hook]
Control, control

[Bridge]
Suicide
Jaws locked around your spine
(Locked around your spine)
