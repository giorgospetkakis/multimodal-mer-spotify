Butterflies
Gravity pulls me into
Anticipate our first touch
Sweet and so new
Let's figure out how to make this forever
Oh this is making me crazy

Hey love I am at the point of no restraint
Let's just make a move and feel the earth quake

It's just you and me
And no one else
It's just you and me
You and me

Slowly now
We shouldn't let this go too fast
Bring me out of this shell
Take off my mask
This is us intertwined and on fire
I cannot stop
I'm consumed with desire
