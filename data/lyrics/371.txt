[Intro:]
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
You belong to me

[Verse 1:]
Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be your girl?
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own

[Chorus:]
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me

[Verse 2:]
You belong to me
Can it be, baby, you're not sure
That you belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
I thought we locked the door, baby
You don't have to prove you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell darling

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Tell that woman something, baby
I believe you know what I want to say to her, yes
Want you to tell her, baby
Tell her that I love you
Tell this woman
Tell her
I ain't lying, baby
I ain't lying

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Everybody knows this baby
All of your friends
All of your friends, all of my friends, baby
Told me this was going on
I can't stand it, baby
What you doing?
Baby, what you doing?
What you doing?
Baby, what you doing?
Where you going?
Baby, where you going?
Where you going?
