The news has got me paranoid
Papers and the news reports
Casualties of every war
The anchor people keeping score
The weapons now are chemicals
In water and in air above
In circulating envelopes
In powder through the postal routes

The threat of a disease is here
We nipped it once without a cure
It took forever till it stopped
Through mandatory needle shots
They gave us all a little dose
To teach our bodies how to cope
Finally when we had it licked
Some terrorists are back with it

The propaganda's working now
I'm falling for it hook and reel
I'm stocking up on medicine
Buying tape to seal us off in

Paranoia!

Paranoia drops bombs

Paranoia!
