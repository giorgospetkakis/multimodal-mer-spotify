[Verse 1]
Going into business
An agreement of your bombast
You'd love my bed
You took the other instead
But don't you feel low?
I was being oblique
And you'd love my bed
You got the other instead

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
What do you owe me?
The price of your peace of mind
You'd love my bed
You took it all instead
