[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?
(Just to spit it in your face)

[Chorus 1]
You know that I don't want you and I never did
I don't want you and I never will

[Verse 2]
You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared, yeah
And you needed proof

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?
(Just to spit it in your face)

[Chorus 2]
You know that I don't love you and I never did
I don't want you and I never will
