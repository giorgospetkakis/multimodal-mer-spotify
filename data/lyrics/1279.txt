[Verse 1]
Two glass eyes
I'll fucking tell you lies
I'm on the side of the road
You're gonna fucking die

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow, pow, pow, oh!

[Verse 2]
Fuck this road
Yeah, fuck you too
I'll fucking kill your best friend
What you fucking gonna do? Here I come

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow! Ah, pow! Woo, pow! Ah, pow!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow!
