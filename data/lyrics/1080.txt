[Verse 1:]
Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
And you got to know baby
We can have a lot of fun

[Chorus:]
I'm a man
I spell M A N, man
A full grown man, lover man
Alright, take it easy now
I hear you, I hear you

[Verse 2:]
All you pretty women stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hour's time
Ain't that amazing?
I spell M A N, man
I'm a man, I'm a man
Full grown man, ain't that a man?
I'm a rollin' stone
Goin' back down to Mississippi to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John, the conqueroo

[Chorus:]
I'm a man
I spell M A N, man
A full grown lover man
I'm a rollin' stone

[Verse 3:]
The line I shoot will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

[Chorus:]
Man
I spell M A N, man
I'm a man
I'm a full grown man, yeah

[Outro:]
A man
I'm a natural born lover man
You don't talk about
A man
