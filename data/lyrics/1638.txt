[Verse 1]
I tell myself I can't have you
It's something that I'll ignore
I tell myself I don't need you
But I'm falling, falling once more
And everyday it gets harder
To pick my heart of the floor
I say it over and over
Girl, you can't have it all, you can't have it all
I dream that you bring me your love
Only in my dreams, it's not enough

[Chorus]
I keep on telling myself, telling myself
I can't have, can't have it all, can't have it all
I keep on telling myself I can't have it all
I can't have you
And now I'm learning to live, learning to live
I'm learning to live on without
Having your love returning
I can't have it all but all that I want is you

[Verse 2]
You remain in the twilight
With eyes that look but don't see
And I'm a book lying open
While you're a lock with no key
I kid myself every morning
That the ache for you is no more
I dream that you bring me your love

[Chorus]
I keep on telling myself, telling myself
I can't have, can't have it all, can't have it all
I keep on telling myself I can't have it all
I can't have you
And now I'm learning to live, learning to live
I'm learning to live on without
Having your love returning
I can't have it all, you're all that I want

[Bridge]
Why won't I listen when I hear them saying
You're better off without a heart that's breaking?
Though I'm fool enough to love
When you don't want me
I'm wise enough to know
That you will always haunt me
Why won't I listen when I hear them saying
You're better off without a heart that's breaking?
Though I'm fool enough to love
When you don't want me
I'm wise enough to know
That you will always haunt me

[Chorus]
I keep on telling myself, telling myself
I can't have, can't have it all, can't have it all
I keep on telling myself I can't have it all
I can't have you
And now I'm learning to live, learning to live
I'm learning to live on without
Having your love returning
I can't have it all but all that I want is you
Why won't I listen when I hear them saying
You're better off without a heart
That's breaking (Is you)
Though I'm fool enough to love
When you don't want me
I'm wise enough to know
That you will always haunt me
And now I'm learning to live, learning to live
I'm learning to live on without
Having your love returning
I can't have it all, you're all that I want
(I'm wise enough to know that you will always haunt me)
