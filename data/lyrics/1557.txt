[Verse]
You alone are holy
And you alone are beauty
But you alone are lonely now

When we're alone, you told me
You'd tell me the whole sad story
But we're never alone now

[Chorus]
Looks like you let it out
For just a moment
And I could see how
You'd only lay me down
On sheets that tore and gave out
I'd never known anyone 'till now

[Verse]
'Cause you belong in poetry
And you belong in fine things
But you belong to someone else

Yeah, you belong in prairie
And you belong in black sea
But you belong to no one town

[Chorus]
You really let it out
For just a moment
And I could see how
You'd only lay me down
On sheets that tore and gave out
I've never known a love 'till now
