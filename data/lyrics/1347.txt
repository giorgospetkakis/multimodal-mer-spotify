[Verse 1]
Babylon's burning
You burn in the street
You burn in your houses
With anxiety

[Chorus]
With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

[Verse 2]
Babylon's burning
You burn in the street
You burn in the ghetto
With anxiety

[Chorus]
With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

[Hook]
Babylon's burning
Baby, can't you see?
Babylon is burning
With anxiety

[Verse 3]
You burn as you work
You burn as you play
The spark of fear is smouldering
With ignorance and hate

[Chorus]
And with anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

[Hook]
Babylon's burning
Baby, can't you see?
Babylon is burning
With anxiety

[Outro]
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
Babylon is burning

Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
