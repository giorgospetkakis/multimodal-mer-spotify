True love regrets to inform you
There are certain things you must do
To perceive his face In the stains on the wall

I didn't know what time it was at all
I didn't know what time it was at all

Foam hands

Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Me and the King have been steadily growing apart
He lives down the hall

I didn't know what time it was at all
I didn't know what time it was at all

Foam hands

I'm not the kind
To tell you what is true
And what is totally out of control

I didn't know what time it was at all
I didn't know what time it was at all

[OUTRO]
Foam hands
Foam hands
Foam hands
Foam hands
