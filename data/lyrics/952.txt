[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm pounding on a big door
No one can hear me knocking
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor
No one can catch me from falling

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
My watch has stopped, no more turning hands
The crew have abandoned the ship
The lights are on but no one is in

[Chorus]
Take it to the bridge, throw it overboard
See if it can swim, back up to the shore
No one's in the house, everyone is out
All the lights are on and the blinds are down

Take it to the bridge, throw it overboard
See if it can swim, back up to the shore
No one's in the house, everyone is out
All the lights are on and the blinds are down

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm calling on a telephone
No one can hear the ringing
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill
No one can stop me from running

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
My watch has stopped, no more turning hands
The little hand shakes its fist
The face is hanging out on a spring

[Chorus] (4x)

[Bridge]
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
Little red grains of sand
My watch has stopped, no more turning hands
Little green neon hands

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Feel like I'm calling back to the shore
No one can hear me calling
Feel like I'm falling back to the floor
No one can catch me from falling
