Well I don't really mind
Where you wanna go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
Now it's temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok

Well it should come as no surprise
When you're dealing with the truth
It should be a state of mind
Or another point of view
So if your confidence is shaken
I can promise it won't break
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok

When nothing's making sense
And the questions never end
You gotta let it go
Every now and then
I can't pretend
But in the end I say that I don't know
And do you believe in miracles?
I hear they happen every day
And if you believe then
We can walk on water

Well I don't really mind
Where you wanna go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
It's temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok

Where you go
What you find
Will remain or pass us by
Some will climb
Some will fall
Some will rise above it all

Promises you make or break
Gone tomorrow, here today
Let it pass
Let it wait
Turn around and walk away

When nothing's making sense
And the questions never end
You gotta let it go
Every now and then
I can't pretend
But in the end I say that I don't know
And do you believe in miracles?
I hear they happen every day
And if you believe then
We can walk on water

Well I don't really mind
Where you wanna go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
Now it's temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok
