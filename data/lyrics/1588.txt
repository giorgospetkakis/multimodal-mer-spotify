*Cheering*

[Verse 1]
Have a seat and listen
Please don’t say a thing
In matters of the heart sometimes the truth will ever sting
Just don’t take it personally, this is no attack
But we will never last because I’m white and you are… also white

[Hook 1]
I only like black girls, the brown girls, the café au lait
The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away
If you are nubian I want you to be in every fantasy
But if you’re a whitey say nighty-nighty you’re just not the girl for me

[Verse 2]
Oh I hate vanilla ice cream I like chocolate instead
I hope she likes her soul food with a little wonder bread
Don’t call it jungle fever ‘cause that just isn't right
I am not a racist some of my best friends are white

[Hook 2]
I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the café au lait
The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away
If you’re a cracker you better get blacker or else you best get out
It is no mystery I like a sister see this is what I’m talking about

[Verse 3]
Our wedding song will be ebony and ivory
And we’ll sing Christmas carols around the old Kwanzaa tree
But color is not the issue here, it's dignity it's class
It’s all about her heart ok it’s partly about that ass

[Hook 3]
I want me some black girls, the brown girls the café au lait
Oh caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away
If you’re a honky your singing the wrong key it’s the honest truth
The skin that she’s dwelling in must contain melanin that is the fountain of youth
