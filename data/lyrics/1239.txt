Her hair
Soft drifted snow
Death white
I’d like to know
Why she hates
All that she does
But she gives
It all that she’s got

Until the sky turns green
The grass is several shades of blue
Every Member of Parliament trips on glue
Until the sky turns green
And the grass is several shades of blue
Every Member of Parliament trips on glue

It takes all these things
And all that time
Till my sugar spun sister’s happy
With this love of mine
It’ll take all these things
And oh much more

I’ve paid
For fifteen or more
But my guts
Can’t take many more
My hands
Are stuck to my jeans
And she knows, she knows
What this must mean

She wakes up with the sun
She asked me what is all the fuss
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think, what have I done?
As I gave her more than I thought I would

It takes all these things
And all that time
Till my sugar spun sister’s happy
With this love of mine

Yeah yeah yeah
The candy floss girl
The sticky fingered boy
Oh, that sister of mine
