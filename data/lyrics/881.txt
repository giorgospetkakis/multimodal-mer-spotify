You are a member of society
You are a member of reality
Do you think it's time that you are called upon?
Do you think it's time that you are seen to be you?

You are real, you exist
You are sane, you're alive
You are here, you are fine
You are you, because you're real

Do you think a lot about the world today?
Do you think a lot about what to say?
Everything you say, it should be listened to
Everything you say, well, it should be understood

You are real, you exist
You are sane, you're alive
You are dreaming, you're a person
You are happy, because you're real

Please show me what it's like to be real
Please show me what it's like to be you
Everything, that is, including me
That's how it is in reality
Everything, that is, including you
That's how it is in reality

Do you have an edge of satisfaction?
Do you have an air of satisfaction?
I want you to tell me that it's what I'm worth
I want you to tell me that I'm significant

You are real, you have feelings
You're important, you have feelings
You are worth it, you have feelings
You're really real, you have feelings
You are real, you exist
You are sane, you're alive
You're impressive, you're important
You are smoking, because you're real
