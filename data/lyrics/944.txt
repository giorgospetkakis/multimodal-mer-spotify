Tiny darling ghost holder
Tiny darling ghost holder
You, our soft spirit breather
And you, our bark-skinned weaver
Remember you could weep fire
Remember you could weep fire
Remember you could weep fire with wild eyes
With wild eyes, ooo those wild eyes

If you ring your cells like bells in a garden
You plant your burdens way deep down in
And water them daily from wells of salty guilt
For sons who'd pollinate the deadly
That wild eye, ooo that wild eye

Papa, my pine whistler sparrow-eyed sun misser
Papa, my pine whistler sparrow-eyed moon blisser
Mama, my jaw clencher spirit mouth ghost dancer
Mama, my vein braider thousand-year bone burner
Mama, my tongue twister thousand-pronged antlers
Mama, my tongue twister thousand-pronged antlers
Mama, my vein braider thousand-pronged antlers, antlers
And ooo her wild eyes, ooo her wild eyes

So I will ring my cells like bells
As you bind your father's molecules with roots of silver
Pierce him cedars with eyes like fingers
Picking bloody flowers
His wild eyes, ooo his wild eyes

Papa, my pine whistler sparrow-eyed sun misser
Papa, my pine whistler sparrow-eyed moon blisser
Mama, my jaw clencher spirit mouth ghost dancer
Mama, my vein braider thousand-year bone burner
Mama, my tongue twister thousand-pronged antlers
Mama, my tongue twister thousand-pronged antlers
Mama, my vein braider thousand-pronged antlers, antlers
Ooo her wild eyes, ooo her wild eyes

Tiny green moss collector
Sweet tiny green moss collector
Remember you could catch fire
Remember you could catch fire
Remember you could catch fire with wild eyes
With wild eyes, ooo those wild eyes

And once the river is rolling lower
We'll gather lichen from the boulders
We'll keep it dry inside our lockets
We'll put this down down into our pockets
We'll try try to leave the branch arms behind
The swaying hands of pines
Their needles tugging at your skin
Trying to pull you back deep
In their wooden womb of a hundred hearts
Hanging, suspended, moth-eaten
Those muscles the size of your fist
All floating around your head
Not knowing who they're a-loving
Not knowing how fast they're a-pumping
Not knowing how hard they're a-beating
Not knowing who they're a-punching
Those muscles the size of your fist
All floating around your head
And throwing punches like we throw the stones
To the bottom of riverbeds
Who knows who is next?
To watch from under the currents
The rapids rapidly raging while rapid
While we're rapidly blinking
Our wild, wild, our wild
Our wild, our wild eyes
