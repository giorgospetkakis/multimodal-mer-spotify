[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you imagine us making love?
The way it would feel the first time that we touch
Can you think of it the way I dream of it?
I want you to see it like I'm seeing it
It's a picture of perfection
The vision of you and I

[Chorus]
Your lips upon my lips (Can you just picture this?)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin
That would be the sweetest sin, yeah

[Verse 2]
All night, I lie awake
'Cause it's too much to take
Dreaming about the love that we could make
All day I think of schemes
To get you next to me
I want you so bad that I can barely breathe
It's a sign of my obsession
That I can't stop thinking 'bout

[Chorus]
Your lips upon my lips (Can you just picture this?)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah (Would be the sweetest sin)
You are the sweetest sin
Your lips upon my lips (My lips)
(Can you envision this?)
Temptation I could never resist
Your skin upon my skin (Oh)
Would be the sweetest sin (Baby, yeah)
That would be the sweetest sin

[Bridge]
It would feel so good, to be so bad
You don't know how bad I want that
I would do anything to feel your...

[Chorus]
Your lips upon my lips (Can you just picture this?)
Your fingertips on my fingertips (On my fingertips)
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin (You are the sweetest sin)
That would be the sweetest sin

[Outro]
Your lips upon my lips
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin
