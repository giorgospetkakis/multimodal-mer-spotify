She's not afraid; she just likes to use her night light
When she gets paid, true religion gets it all
If they fit right

She's a little bit manic, completely organic
Doesn't panic for the most part

She's old enough to know, and young enough not to say no
To any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head
Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds

She's a Gemini Capricorn
Thinks all men are addicted to porn
I don't agree with her half the time
But, damn I'm glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She got the kinda strength that every man wishes he had
She loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad

Tells me that she lives about a hundred lives
Scares me to death when she thinks and drives
Says cowboy hats make her look fat
And I'm so glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She doesn't know the word 'impossible'
Don't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're goin' to
She takes me as I am, and that ain't easy
She's beautiful. So beautiful

And sometimes I think she's truly crazy
And I love it

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She's not afraid
She just likes to use her night light
