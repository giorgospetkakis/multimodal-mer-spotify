[Chorus: All]
(Bring it all back now)
Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back)

[Verse 1: Jo & Rachel]
Hold on to what you try to be
Your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders
Just smile and let it go
If people try to put you down
Just walk on by, don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Jo]
Don't you know it's true what they say
That life, it ain't easy
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

[Chorus: All]
Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now, yeah, yeah)

[Hook: All, Paul]
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (bring back, bring back, na na na)

[Verse 2: Tina & Hannah]
Try not to worry 'bout a thing
Enjoy the good times life can bring
Keep it all inside you
Gotta let the feelings show
Imagination is the key
'Cause you are your own destiny
You never should be lonely
When time is on your side

[Pre-Chorus: Rachel]
Don't you know it's true what they say
Things are sent to try you
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

[Chorus: All]
Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)

[Hook: All, Jon, Bradley]
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (bring it on, bring it on back now)
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (bring it on back to me, baby)

[Bridge: Jo]
Don't you know it's true what they say
Things happen for a reason
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

[Chorus: All]
Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)

[Chorus: All, Bradley]
Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love (shake your body)
Anything you've been thinking of (and let me see you sway)
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (shake your body) (bring it all back now)

[Chorus: All, Jo]
Don't stop, never give up (don't stop)
Hold your head high and reach the top (don't stop)
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
