When the feelings are right
My hands start to reach very high
When I'm feeling so right
My hands start to reach very high

Sorry for it
Sorry for me
Cause bees and butterflies down in my hands
Now I have to teach them
How to fly
How to fly

When the feelings are right
Put down together in round
When I'm feeling the right
Holding to catch the stars

Sorry for it
Sorry for me
Cause bees and butterflies they are now my slaves
Now I have to teach them
How to fly
How to fly
