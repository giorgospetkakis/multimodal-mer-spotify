The end is coming soon
Humanity has reached its doom
Fire falls from the sky, the earth erupts in flames
No escape from the inevitable, end of days

Planets have aligned
We have no more time this is the end
Planets have aligned
We have no more time this is the end

The end of existence, the end of mankind
The end of existence, the end of mankind

Witness the end of existence, we have no more time
Witness the end of existence, we have no more time
Witness the end of existence, we have no more time
Witness the end of existence, we have no more time

The end of existence, the end of mankind
The end of existence, the end of mankind
The end of existence, the end of mankind
The end of existence, the end of mankind
