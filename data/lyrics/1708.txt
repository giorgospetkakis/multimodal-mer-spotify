If I had no place to fall and I needed to
Could I count on you to lay me down?

I'll never tell you, no lies
I don't believe it's wise
You got pretty eyes, won't you spin me 'round?

I'm not much of a lover, it's true
I'm here and I'm gone and I'm forever blue
But I'm sure wanting you

The sky falls silver and gold
It tries to hide the sun but it can't be done
'Least not for long

But if we help each other grow
While the light of day smiles down our way
Oh, we can't go wrong

But time, she is a fast old train
She's here and she's gone and she won't come again
So won't you take my hand?

If I had no place to fall and I needed to
Could I count on you to lay me down?
