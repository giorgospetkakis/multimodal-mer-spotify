Someone wanna come around
Dumpin' fun around
I bring my pan around
And pop one in your shoulder
And pop one in your shoulder

Won't no be the same
Won't no be the same

A stumble pacifist
Christian on my list
Cause I'm fingers and Noah's
You need to hold on
A stumbled a pacifist
Christian's on my list
Cause I'm feeling the fluid
They need to hold it

I come on fast as this
Like a Viper Kiss
Tricky make a vapour
Make you get your cold on
I wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown
I come like underground
And make you feel older

Ooh, I love it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And, when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

I wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown
I come like underground
I make you feel older
I wrap my tongue around
You get to be the clown

Ooh, I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
Ooh, I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

Someone wanna come around
Dumpin' fun around
I bring my pan around
And pop one in your shoulder
And pop one in your shoulder
And pop one in your shoulder

Ooh, I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

Ooh, I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do

Ooh, I like it so much
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
And when it comes to your touch
I'm doing things I wouldn't normally do
