Oh mercy, girl you lookin' sexy
Movin' on across the floor
Oh mercy, girl you lookin' sexy
Saw you comin' through the door

Oh baby, such a fine lady
Talkin' and your voice is deep
Oh baby, such a fine lady
I can hardly speak - Monique!

She's a freak, Monique
I think I'm gonna tweek
She's a freak, Monique
I can hardly speak
She's a freak, Monique
I think I'm gonna tweek
She's a freak, Monique
I can hardly speak

Sexy baby, girl you drive me crazy
Let me take you for a drive
Sexy baby, girl you drive me crazy
My body comes alive - body comes alive

Girl you so divine
Oh there's no use tryin'
Make ya feel so fine
Gotta have you girl
Take you 'round the world
Make ya start to swirl
Such a lovely girl

She's a freak, Monique
I think I'm gonna tweek
She's a freak, Monique
I can hardly speak
She's a freak, Monique
I think I'm gonna tweek
She's a freak, Monique
I can hardly speak

Freaky girl, freaky girl, freaky girl

Sexy baby, girl you drive me crazy
Let me take you for a drive - let me take you for a drive
Sexy baby, girl you drive me crazy

She's a freak, Monique
I can hardly speak
