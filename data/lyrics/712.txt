Regret has gone down in my estimation now
The old world had you smiling out
Putting your arms around
I tell myself now
Things I would have told to you
The smallest plan, the greatest news
The more days come, the more it's true

Right now I've got to get back home
In from the sad day out
Missing you forever
Yes, I shout, yes I, yes I, yes I am

It seems the right time
To let go of the steep incline
Of this day and to know you're mine
Forever and I will be fine
In me will you shine
Shine, shine, will you shine

I'm stepping through
The streams and fountains of the sad day out
Missing you forever
Yes, I shout, yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
