Regret has gone down in my estimation now
The old world had you smiling out
Putting your arms around
I tell myself now
Things I would have told to you
The smallest plan, the greatest news
The more days come, the more it's true

[Chorus]
Right now I've got to get back home
In from the sad day out
Missing you forever
Yes, I shout, yes I, yes I, yes I am
I'm going down the Lakeshore Drive
I think I see your face
Now I'm looking for you every place
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am

It seems the right time
To let go of the steep incline
Of this day and to know you're mine
Forever and I will be fine
In me will you shine
Shine, shine, will you shine

[Chorus]
Right now I've got to get back home
In from the sad day out
Missing you forever
Yes, I shout, yes I, yes I, yes I am
I'm going down the Lakeshore Drive
I think I see your face
Now I'm looking for you every place
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus 2]
I'm stepping through
The streams and fountains of the sad day out
Missing you forever
Yes, I shout, yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
I'm going down the Lakeshore Drive
I think I see your face
Now I'm looking for you every place
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am
Yes I, yes I, yes I am

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
