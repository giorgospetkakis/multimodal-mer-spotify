[Verse 1]
Petrified for the millionth time
Slowly my soul evaporates
No parachutes no dismal clouds
Just this fucking space

[Chorus]
I know what's coming
I'm not working
I know what's coming
I'm not working

[Verse 2]
Sweating out intelligence
Like I don't know what it is
Clinging to the microwaves
And singing with the sound waves

[Chorus]
I know what's coming
I'm not working
I know what's coming
I'm not working

[Bridge]
Delirium on helium
I am my own experience

[Chorus]
I know what's coming
I'm not working
I know what's coming
I'm not working

[Outro]
I'm not working
I'm not working
I'm not working
