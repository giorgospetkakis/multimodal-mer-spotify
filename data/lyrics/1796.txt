Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers and your pearls, hey girl
When I walk through the door I'm a debutante
When I come through the door I'm a debutante

The jet is freaking, the guest list is speakin'
We jet to Ibiza, the people are shrieking
The world kids are cravin' a ravin ' invasion
I come from the future of next school new wavin'
New York is so fly, my high rise is so high
The height of my high style comes right from the turnstile

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers and your pearls, hey girl
When I walk through the door I'm a debutante
When I come through the door I'm a debutante

The comic guru otaku, Tokyo
Dj come Dj go, elavate electro
London is burning turntables are turning
Nightclubs are discerning my love is returning,...
