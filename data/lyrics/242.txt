What an affair
That keeps me longing
For someone there, for someone new
You were so good
In doing the wrong thing
Now I'll be good in being untrue
I've bad my share
Of lazy lovers
I took the chance, I found my cure
Somebow, somewhere
You will discover
A decent girl named Belle de Jour
Glamour, fashion, diamond rings
Cars with shiny chrome
I rather care for simple things
Pure testosterone
What an affair
That keeps me longing
For someone there, for someone new
You were so good
In doing the wrong thing
Now I'll be good in being untrue
What an affair
What an affair
What an outrageously
Mundane mad love affair
