You tried to make good
Hiding out in the neighborhood
Getting by and it's understood
There's no time like the time right before the flood

You get high to feel your love
It's alright, so you need the crutch
Step aside, wonder what's up
You close your eyes
You see you've missed so much

Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky
Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky

You can fly in your dreams
Floating by the black and white scenery
Take a drive where lovers leap
Only to arrive dead on your feet

Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky
Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky

Oh, this stiff heart of mine (stiff heart of mine)
If ever there was a time (there was a time)
Only you must leave these things behind

The paint is peeling off
The hood of this old truck
As you drive into the West
Where the eye of God is sinking fast

Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky
Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky

Bring on the blue sky
Bring on the blue sky
Bring on the blue sky
Bring on blue sky
