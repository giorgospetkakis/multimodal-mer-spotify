[Verse 1]
He worries no more than he
Necessarily needs to fill his void
As big as space never ending thrill
He meets his will by choosing hate
(Why choosing?)

Why choosing?
Need us to smile too?
Alright

[Verse 2]
Struggling to prevail

Foretaste
The aftermath
Which will be black
As black as waste
(Why choosing?)

[Bridge]
We'll throw in an extra dance
For just a little over 5 pence
(Why choosing?)
Need us to smile too?
Alright
You'll turn our limo into a hearse
Weighing just enough to run it over your curse
(Why choosing?)
Need us to smile too?

Why choosing?
Ooohh...
Alright
(Why choosing?)

[Bridge]
