Cross the lines down shifting lights
Catch it's breath a stream of life
The tallest trees stretch to the sea
And to the edge where shadows meet

A quiet place and nature's way
A season comes and whispers life
Still born again into golden dreams
A Hiding place beneath blue skies

Cross the lines down shifting lights
Catch it's breath a stream of life
The tallest trees stretch to the sea
And to the edge where shadows meet
