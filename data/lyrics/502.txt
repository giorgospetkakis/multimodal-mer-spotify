[Verse 1]
We were one in words
You finished my sentence
I could never attract tomorrow
It pushes me aside

[Verse 2]
I sink in waters deep
Your presence kept me floating
Far from depths where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime
I can be the first you meet

[Pre-Chorus]
I once read a poem
Held my breath but that moment's gone
First time I felt life somewhat hurts
I need an option, a reason and some hope

[Chorus]
Yell at me, I want to
Be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking
And I might fall
I wish that I could say
I wish that I could be your
Evil, evil in a closet

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Yell at me, I want to
Be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking
And I might fall
I wish that I could say
I wish that I could be your
Evil, evil in a closet
