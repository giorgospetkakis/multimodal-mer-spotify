[Verse 1]
If you stand tall with your back to the door
Then it's your own fault when you get knocked to the floor
You may have fooled me once
But I've got a pretty damn good memory
It's a small world, what a tired clich√©
But it's a small world, how many times can I say
That everything you do will end up coming right back around again

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you
I'm sorry for you
Yeah, the people that you keep around
Well, you learn from them and they learn from you

[Chorus]
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Yeah, keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Well you just might start to melt them down
And I come around
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket

[Verse 2]
It's a long haul to the front of the line
And you get there in your own sweet time
But there's always somebody who decides to cut right in front of you
Wide eyed, looking for a ticket to ride
It's a long night, I hope we make it out alive
You can't spend your whole life worrying about what's behind you

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you
I'm sorry for you
Yeah, the people that you keep around
Well, you learn from them and they learn from you

[Chorus]
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Yeah, keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Well you just might start to melt them down
And I come around
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket

[Verse 3]
Oh, it's a life in colour, not black and white
But some people think they're the ones who got it right
In a room so full, well
You have to be a little more flexible

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you
I'm sorry for you
Yeah, the people that you keep around
Well, you learn from them and they learn from you

[Chorus]
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Yeah, keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Well you just might start to melt them down
And I come around
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
