Prettiest thing
I ever did see
Was lightning from the top of a cloud
Moving through the dark million miles an hour
With somewhere to be

So why does it seem
Like a picture
Is hangin' up on someone else's wall
Lately I just haven't been myself at all
It's heavy on my mind

And I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
I still know

That the prettiest thing
I ever did see
Was dusty as the handle on the door
Rusty as a nail stuck in the ol' pine floor
Looks like home to me

Now I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
Thinkin' of the prettiest thing

Dreamin'
Dreamin'
