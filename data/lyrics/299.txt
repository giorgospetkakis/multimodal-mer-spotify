[Chorus 1]
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you feel the magic hanging in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh, no
And sometimes I wonder why we're here
But I don't care, I don't care

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh, no
Sometimes I I'm dancing on air
But I get scared, I get scared

[Verse]
When I hear the drummer, get me in the groove
When I hear the guitar, makes me want to move
Can you feel the magic, floating in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah
Sometimes you're feeling you've been pushed around
And your rainbow just ain't here
Don't you fear, don't you fear
When you hear the music trouble disappear
When you hear the music ringing in your ears
Can you feel the magic floating in the air?
Can you hear the magic? Oh, yeah, yeah
When you hear the music ringing in my ear
Can you hear the music? Oh, yeah
Can you hear the drummer? Gets you in the groove
Can you hear the guitar? Make you want to move? Yeah
Can you hear the music? Oh, yeah
Can you hear the music ringing in my ear?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
