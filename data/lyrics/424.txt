I've learnt a lot about you
In turn much about me too
I travelled across the sea
I wept for you

Emotions run deep
Between us friend
The time will come
For us again

We're tired, we're tired now
This ship almost ran aground
We'll lie and rest now
I'll dream of you

Emotions run deep
Between good friends
But I do believe
In us again

I've heard, I've heard it said
That love, real love has no end
A cup overflowing now
I will believe
I must believe
I must believe
I must believe
