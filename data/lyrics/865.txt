[Verse 1]
Ignoring a loss of sight
Afraid to blink, I might lose the sun
But don't make this out to be more than it isn't
Behind every lie, there's a burden within
Yes, you're my sight!

[Bridge]
This suffering
That's kept within
Disposable men
Lost

[Verse 2]
Inside, he was negative
This place, once more was underground
So look and connect, we're refusing to rust
Healing has to begin in the past

[Chorus]
So don't fake this! Don't fake this!
Don't fake this! Don't!

[Bridge]
This suffering (you, you)
That's kept within (you, you)
Disposable men (you, you)
Lost (you, you)

[Chorus]
Don't fake this! Don't fake this!
Don't fake this! Don't!
Fake! Fake! Fake!

[Bridge]
This suffering (you, you)
That's kept within (you, you)
Disposable men (you, you)
Lost (you, you)

[Chorus]
So don't fake this! Don't fake this!
Don't fake this! Don't!
Fake! Fake! Fake!
