[Verse 1]
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

[Verse 2]
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

[Chorus]
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Verse 3]
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

[Verse 4]
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

[Chorus]
Would you say I told you so? Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Outro]
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
