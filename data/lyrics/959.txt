[Verse 1]
Cowboys don't cry
And heroes don't die
Good always wins
Again and again
And love is a sweet dream
That always comes true
Oh if life were like the movies
I'd never be blue

[Chorus]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darling it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

[Verse 2]
I gave you my love
But that wasn't enough
To hold your heart
When times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would

[Chorus]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darling it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

[Outro]
No the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world
