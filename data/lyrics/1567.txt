I - am a ready die
The world won't miss me
You wanna know why?
Humanity - is out of control
Why should I stay and play my lousy role?

I - can't stand the pain
The script is written
Don't wanna remain
Now - the time is right
Won't be too difficult
To give up the last fight

Fear of the moment
My world is a maze with a dead end
Fear of the moment
The will to live is hard to defend

If I - would pass away
Would they ever miss me
Maybe just for one day?
If I - would have real friends
The dead end would make no fucking sense

This pain is shredding - rewind!
The sense of a free mind

I - I feel the season is right
To attract attention and stop the fight
Why - you wanna know why?
My time isn't up
I'm not ready to die!!!
