Out of the mist into tropical splendor
With garlands of flowers
In Majestical fusion we see tonight

Onto this sacred reunion of pleasure
They row as a rhythm, ten-thousands of millions
They touch the light

King is sailing they say
King is sailing we hear
King is sailing they say
King is sailing this day of days of days
Coca say Tey Toka

Heaven set sail in his ship full of light
He transcends all our love
To caress all our fears in a moment divine

Weakest and strongest will dance in delight
All illumines our savior, they bringing him forth
We will sing tonight

Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come
Our true Kingdom come

Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Aaaaaaah ah aaaaaaah
Ah aaaaaaah ah aaaaaaah
Aaaaaaah ah aaaaaaah
Ah aaaaaaah ah aaaaaaah
