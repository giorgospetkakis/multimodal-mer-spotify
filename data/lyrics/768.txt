These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

How many more ways can I explain this to you boy
We have had this conversation several times before
I will except nothing less than your complete respect
If you cannot give me that then maybe I should step

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

All this cryin all this fightin simply ain't my style
Though you're one of the most important people in my life
I loved you from the day we met, I know you loved me too
But at this point walking away is the best thing we can do

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

Were we meant to be man and wife?
The answer I don't know
Of life's many mystery's what intrigues me the most
Is who our children would have been
I guess we'll never know
Even as I walk away I'll always keep the hope

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
That's life

That's the way the story goes
Truth is every relationship is a lesson
Truth is I saw it coming but it hurts anyway
Truth is I'm not the reason you're so angry
Truth is you're not the reason I'm so passive
Truth is I've got to take back my power
Truth is

The reason why it hurts so bad
To walk away from you

These eyes I never saw you leavin
This heart my heart is in need of some healing
These arms, These arms are letting you go
The greatest story never told (2x)

Our love is the greatest story never told
Our life is the greatest story never told (2x)

And that's the way the story goes...
