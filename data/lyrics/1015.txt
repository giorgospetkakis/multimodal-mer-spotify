[Verse 1]
Batman got on my nerves
He was running me amok
He ridiculed me, calling me a bum

[Chorus]
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass

[Verse 2]
Batman thought he was bad
He was a fucking asshole in the first place
He got knocked to the floor

[Chorus]
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass

[Verse 3]
Batman beat the hell out of me and knocked me to the floor
I got back up and knocked him to the floor
He was being such a jackoff

[Chorus]
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped Batman's ass
I wupped... Batman's ass

[Outro]
Rock over, London
Rock on, Chicago
