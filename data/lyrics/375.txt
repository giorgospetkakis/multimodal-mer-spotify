[Intro]
Fish don't fry in the kitchen

[Verse 1]
Vulcanize the whoopee stick in the ham wallet
Cattle prod the oyster ditch with the lap rocket
Batter dip the cranny ax in the gut locker
Retrofit the pudding hatch, oh, la, la – with the boink swatter

[Pre-Chorus]
If I get you in the loop when I
Make a point to be straight with you then
In lieu of the innuendo in the end know my intent though
I Brazilian wax poetic so hypothetically
I don't wanna beat around the bush

[Chorus]
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo

[Verse 2]
Marinade the nether rod in the squish mitten
Power drill the yippee bog with the dude piston
Pressure wash the quiver bone in the bitch wrinkle
Cannonball the fiddle cove, oh, la, la – with the pork steeple

[Pre-Chorus]
If I get you in the loop when I make a point to be straight with you then
In lieu of the innuendo in the end know my intent though
I Brazillian wax poetic so hypothetically
I don't wanna beat around the bush

[Chorus]
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo

[Outro]
Put the "you know what" in the "you know where"
Put the "you know what" in the "you know where"
Put the "you know what" in the "you know where"
Put the "you know what" in the "you know where"
Pronto!
