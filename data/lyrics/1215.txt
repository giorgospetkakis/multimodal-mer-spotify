[Verse]
She's a victim of her senses
Do you know her?
Can you see her in the distance
As she tumbles by?
Veteran of a race
That should be over
Can you hear her sigh?
With wings to fly
She rolls along
Doing it wrong
Oh, I've loved her so long[x2]
There's a place that I know
We could go
Get away for a while
I can bring her the peace
That she needs
Give her reason to smile

[Outro][Repeat until fade]
Oh, I've loved her so long
