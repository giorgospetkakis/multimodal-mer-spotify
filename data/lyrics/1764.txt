[Verse 1/Hook]
These are the days that I've been missing;
Give me the taste
Give me the joy of summer wine
These are the days that bring new meaning;
I feel the stillness of the sun
And I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when the nights are closing early
I remember you and I start to smile
Even though now you don't want to know me
I get on by
And I go the extra mile

[Verse 3/Hook]
These are the times of love and meaning;
Ice of the heart melted away and found the light
These are the days of endless dreaming;
Troubles of life are floating away like a bird in flight
These are the days
These are the days
These are the days

[Verse 4]
I thought you said our love would last forever
Believin' that the tears would end for good
I told them that we'd get though any weather
Maybe that didn't work out, but we did the best we could

[Hook/Outro]
These are the days that I've been missing;
Give me the taste
Give me the joy of summer wine
These are the days that bring new meaning;
I feel the stillness of the sun
And I feel fine
