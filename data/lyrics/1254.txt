The photos on my wall
The glow of the off switch
It's so good to hear your voice
As a stolen guitar falls

I don't think before I speak
I, I, I, I break you're heart

Just waiting for your turn to speak
Everyone's got an opinion
I stair and nod my head
And leave straight when it finishes

And I think I could do better
So, so, so, so arrogant

You read and it makes no sense
Don't understand a single word he says
My head hurts from being on the phone
And my ears are ringing from the night before

I don't think before I speak
I, I, I, I break you're heart
I think I could do better
So, so, so, so arrogant
