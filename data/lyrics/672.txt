[Verse 1]
If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you

[Chorus]
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine

[Verse 2]
All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And shown me how to love unselfishly
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
In my dreams i couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine

Ra lala lala lalaaaahhh
[Chorus]
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
'cause all i need is you, my Valentine
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine
