[Verse 1: Joe Bouchard]
Deep in the heart of Germany
Lucy clutched her breast in fear
She heard a beat of her lover’s heart
For weeks she raved in dreams he appeared
From far off Transylvania

[Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
To Nosferatu

[Verse 2: Joe Bouchard]
The ship pulled in without a sound
The faithful captain long since cold
He kept his log ’til the bloody end
Last entry read “rats in the hold
My crew is dead—I fear the plague”

[Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself

[Bridge: Joe Bouchard]
Mortal terror reigned
Sickness now, then horrible death
Only Lucy knew the truth
And at her window
Nosferatu

[Verse 3: Joe Bouchard]
So chaste, so calm, she gave herself
To the pleasure of the dreaded master
He sucked the precious drops of life
Throughout the long and cold, dark night

[Bridge: Joe Bouchard]
One last goodbye (goodbye), he was blinded by love
One last goodbye (goodbye), he was blinded by love
Blinded by love

[Verse 4: Joe Bouchard]
He screamed with fear, he’d stayed too long in her room
The morning sun had come too soon
The spell was broken with a kiss of doom
He vanished into dust, left her all alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
To Nosferatu
