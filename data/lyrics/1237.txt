If there was a demon would you hold her?
And be a nurse by her side?
I'll take a corset of your words
Tie them up high and bind them
You seem like you've always been
Wrote a book that's already been read

And if there was a beast would you hold him?
And be a doctor by his side?
He'll take the drugs that you've stolen
You'll be drunk on electric wine
Oh this town you've never seen before
There's always big guns at your door
The sentiment of class is blood born

I'd like to write a song for you
With arms wide open the way I do
And I'd like to tell the truth to you
Shot through the chest the way I do

If there was a demon would you hold her?
And be a nurse by her side?
I'll take a corset of your words
Tie them up high and bind them
