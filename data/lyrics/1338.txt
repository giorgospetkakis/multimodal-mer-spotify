Since the beginning I've been thinking of a way
Since the beginning I knew I couldn't change
I knew from day one that this never had a chance
Its all fake, Its all in the past
Partial understanding of my forced identity; I'm dead inside and it's all I'll ever be
I gave up everything, I gave it all away
Partial understanding of my forced identity; all we have is false hope
