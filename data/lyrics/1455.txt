[Intro]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

[Verse 1]
Wait 'til you have reached the age, blah blah
History has turned the page, blah blah
We still wanna hear a brand new thing, uh huh
We still need a song to sing, uh huh

[Pre-Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

[Chorus]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow 'til the end of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes
And the beat goes
And the beat goes on

[Chorus]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

[Chorus]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
The world keeps turning faster everyday (Everyday)
We still wanna dance the night away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
