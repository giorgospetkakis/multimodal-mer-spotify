There's a new leader in the land
With a platform that I understand
I saw her face in the magazine
She looks hot in her tight jeans

Keep marching on
A solider of love
Jenna Bush army
You can't stop her
Jenna Bush army

She's got the brains and the looks that kill
Want to see her butt on a ten dollar bill
Ready your vote for her ballot box
You've got to admit it, she's a fox

Keep marching on
Soldier of love
Jenna Bush army
You can't stop her
Jenna Bush army

I don't care who blows up the world
I only care about that girl
Men of America, storm the election
When in doubt, follow your erection
Call up your congressman and I say, quote
"Sir, I'm horny and I vote"
Come ye, rally 'round the flag
If you don't like her, you must be a fag

Jenna Bush army
