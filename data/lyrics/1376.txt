[Verse 1]
On a night like tonight you saved my life
Red and green wet shoes slip on refracted lights
Running faster than my legs can take me
Shouting louder than my lungs allow me

[Chorus]
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now

[Verse 2]
Light a match, bring the flame over to your eye
Slipping past, you won't see me before you die
Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching
This war is killing you and all around me

[Chorus]
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now

[Bridge]
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone
Be my embrace now
Be my embrace now
