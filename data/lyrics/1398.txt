How can you call yourself a god?
Don't even bother to interfere
Created in your fucking image
What kind of creep does that make you anyway?
There is no Hell
We are already here
And why do I fear death
If I'm already dead?

Why should I be able to hate?
Why all this envy?
Should I be able to kill for this land?
Is this what you are?

And what is evil?
If this is the light
Then what is darkness?
Just a brick in a game

Answer me
What do you want from me?
