A loose grip on a thin line
Leaves me trailing behind
I know I've far to go
But your steps are too small

Now and again
Take me down a peg
You know I can get so lost
Even if it's true
From anyone but you
Nothing would get through my wall

I lose touch in your goals
It's vertigo
And your words are like
Music to the beast
It's all lights and smoke
It's political
And my grip remains true
Though the line may swerve
