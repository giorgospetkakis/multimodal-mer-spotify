Our souls are not ready for life
We're gonna have a fight
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies
Coming out to the streets
They'll complete what we did
Or what we wished to destroy
They'll mess up despite the next
Outside our souls react to raging crowds. Tonight
They'll kill and demonstrate what fight is all about
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins
Our fragile conscience lies awaiting for a war
Where liars and honest people fight to get some money
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing
What you do has no meaning
Consider the fight's all around"
Inside I'm wandering, inside I'm wandering...
