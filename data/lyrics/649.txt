All the faces on the photographs have changed
To not confuse it all, the names remain the same
Should I wait or let the past just fall?
The whispers are veiled
Should you try to realign some day
You may find that there was nothing anyway
Is it me or did we all get bored insane?
Playing the game
I'm peering through the holes
Been digging through the dirt
Trying to save the small yesterdays
