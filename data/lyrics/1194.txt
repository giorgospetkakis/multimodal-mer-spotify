There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do
A river winding blue among the dunes and a marble bed
A sun that doesn't set but settles
There is no such place
If I lower mine to yours would you kiss me on the face?
If you're looking for an unmarked place
There is no such place -
Blasted in appearance and a composite of fearful minutes
Frozen in the waking instant
Longing, things I long for
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door
O come in, come in
You've been here before
There is no such place, so perhaps we have a reason
For our long and falling face
Above all it would be warm but we would keep our heads all
Clear as Winter, storms would be a sight to make us shiver
But without the chill
Of thinking all is hither-thither -
Longing, Things I long for
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door
O come in, come through the door
You've been here before
You've been here before
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do
A house upon a hill with no windows
Just a can upon the sill
To catch your tears
To feed your garden
