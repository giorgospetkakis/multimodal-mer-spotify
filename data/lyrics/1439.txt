Enter the Ghost Lake
The waters whisper
Of something brooding
No way out of here

Slow smouldering
Slow rain(ing) heat
Lapping at your skin
Pulling you down again

I wish that I could
Fan back to life
The dying embers
Of my long lost passion

Descending deeper
With black as my light
With twist and turn
All men will be tried in life

We look for light to call
The call to save us all
Lest we fall to our knees
The death, we kiss his feet
Oh, sacred mother come
For our fate is done
In blindness do we run
Always backwards

The care of many
Was lost in my hands
The sickness came in
Floods of torment and woe

My withered body
Aching and bone tired
My christ who art lord
Hold me down again

Knee bent and head held low
Eyes closed against my foe
In prayer I sing on low
Answers to my last call
Oh, sacred father come
For it is you who's done
In blindness do we (signs "you will") run
And be sure not to fall

Oh, christ, what have I done?
Ill fortune now will come
Fire raining from the sun
All virtue swept away
In floods of blackest death
The ghost will take my breath
My sins I will forget
I am nothing again

Exit the Ghost Lake
The waters silent
What now has risen?
No man stands alone

The world is changing
'Tis misery who
Leads our way now
Holding man down
