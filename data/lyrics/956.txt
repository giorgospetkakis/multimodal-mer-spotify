We're getting higher every time that we love
A little closer to the things we fall back on
If you come over, then together, willing
We'll take over the world

You call me closer
I said, "Maybe, yeah,"
But I'm proven wrong
By all the things we talk about
The summer air is here
So get your dress on
And dance around like no one cares

Come on, come on, come on
You know you've gotta
Come on, come on, come on and celebrate
'Cause we are together, made for each other
We can stand alone
And now no one can touch us

We're falling faster
Will you think about it?
If I fall over, will you catch me, baby?
'Cause there's an awful lot of people waiting
To get their hands on everything we've got

Come on, come on, come on
You know you've gotta
Come on, come on, come on and celebrate
'Cause we are together, made for each other
We can stand alone [x2]

And now no one can touch us

And I'll be singing
'Cause you're all I need
And I'll be singing
'Cause you're all I need

We're getting higher every time that we love
A little closer to the things we fall back on
If you come over, then together, willing
We'll take over the world

Come on, come on, come on
You know you've gotta
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause we are together, made for each other
We can stand alone
(No one, no one can touch us)
And now no one can touch us
