[Chorus]
Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night

Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night

Seems I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I think I feel much better at night

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night

Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night

Seems I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I think I feel much better at night

[Instrumental Break]
