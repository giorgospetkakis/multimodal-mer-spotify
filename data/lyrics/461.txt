Can
Can we die to live an other day?

How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for if we do not know when to let go

What is this life that we cling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us
These fading sentiments
Can we die

Can we die to live another day
Can we die to live another day
Can we die to live another day

What is this life that we cling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us
These fading sentiments

How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for if we do not know when to let go

How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for if we do not know when to let go
