Golden waves
In all directions
I could lose my soul right here

Colour lights
On the runway
Makes a stranger feel unchained

I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
Summer days will come happiness will be mine
I'm lost in my words I don't know where I'm going
I do the best I can not to worry about things

I feel loose
I feel haggard
Don't know what I'm looking for

Something true
Something lovely
That will make me feel alive

I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
Summer days will come happiness will be mine
I'm lost in my words I don't know where I'm going
I do the best I can not to worry about things

Like a vagabond in the distance
Looking for a song to sing
A song that lasts all night
And for the rest of our lives

I'm lost in my words I don't know where I'm going
I do the best I can not to worry about things
I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
(I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine)
Summer days will come happiness will be mine
(Summer days will come happiness will be mine)
I'm lost in my words I don't know where I'm going
(I'm lost in my words I don't know where I'm going)
I do the best I can not to worry about things
(I do the best I can not to worry about things)

I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
(I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine)
Summer days will come happiness will be mine
(Summer days will come happiness will be mine)

Oh, shit!
