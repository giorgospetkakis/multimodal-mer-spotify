You can cut my heart in sections
And I'll show you no objection
Cause it's better than being alone
It's better than being alone
And there's a strange elation
In your subtle assassination
I thought I saw a glimmer of hope
I thought I saw a glimmer of hope

But I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)

I could stay here in the middle
And speak to you in riddles
But I'd rather just feel the burn
I'd rather feel the burn
So you can strike me with your matches
And scatter me like ashes
Your little angel playing in your dirt

But I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)

Some things I keep to myself
Some things are better left unsaid
And sometimes I feel like this could break me in half
Still some things I'll never, ever tell

But I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)

And I will let you chain me down for a while
And I will let you wear my crown for a while
