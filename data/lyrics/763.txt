[Chorus 1]
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

[Chorus 2]
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free

[Chorus 3]
It's alright, she says
It's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything
Fly on, little wing

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Anything[x3]
