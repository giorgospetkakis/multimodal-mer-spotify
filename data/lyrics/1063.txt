Wounded hands, wounded feet
Taken down, left to bleed

Forces let this go
Whispered to never know
Escape

Erase my breath
Erase my being everything

Wield your mastery mask
Our destiny of blind deceit

Shrouded moon
Shadowed night
My eyes escape

Erase my breath
Erase my being everything

Drag me kicking, screaming
Torn red, revealing
My escape

Erase my breath
Erase my being everything
Retrace my steps in case you dream of me
