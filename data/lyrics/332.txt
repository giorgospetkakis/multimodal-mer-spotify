[Verse 1]
I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone
But where do I go from here, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

[Verse 2]
Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
Making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

[Bridge]
Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
Because baby, I can't live

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you
