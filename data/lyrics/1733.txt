[Intro]
"I would like to face reality, let me tell you there's over three-thousand groups operating in this country today and the number is growing. As Christians we gotta take on the armor of Christ and go to battle against Satan."

[Verse 1]
Man in the front got a sinister grin
Careen down highway 666
We wanna go, crush the slow
As the pitchfork bends the needles grow

[Chorus]
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement
We're going to ride to the abbey of Thelema
To the abbey of Thelema
Blood is pavement

[Verse 2]
The grill in the front is my sinister grin
The bugs in my teeth make me sick, sick, sick
The objects may be larger than they appear in the mirror

[Chorus]
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement
We're going to ride to the abbey of Thelema
To the abbey of Thelema
Blood is pavement

[Post-Chorus]
"When you ride, you're ridden"
"When you ride, you're ridden"

[Interlude]
"Beep beep, beep beep
His horn went beep beep beep"

[Bridge]
I am fueled by filth and fury
Do what I will, I will hurry there, there

[Chorus]
Yeah!
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement

Fuck it

My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels
My blood is pavement, pavement, pavement

[Outro]
"Go home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch you!? Tell her this isn't some Communist day-care center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!"

[Phone Ringing]

"I want my son off of your mailing list, I have already contacted the post office about your pornographic material that is being received in the mail, my next stop is my attorney. I do not want this number called anymore, and I do not want anything delivered to my address. If I receive anything else from this band, or this group, my next phone call will be my attorney, and you will be contacted. Thank you and good-bye!"
