[Verse 1]
To think I showed such promise, such potential as a lover
But I guess I had my hands full with myself without another
To occupy my fancies to take root amongst the woods
Hell, I should have known I'd never come up with the goods
I never could

[Chorus]
I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

[Verse 2]
I've said and I've done things in my time and make you shiver
I've spent time with wistful eyes just staring at the river
In the end I couldn't even find the words she wanted me to say
In her heart she knows she never knew me anyway
What can I say?

[Chorus]
I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die

[Bridge]
Take for instance if you will a person you don't care for
Not someone you hate, just someone you turn off the phone for
Spare a thought for them because no matter how much they whine and they moan
There's not a bad thing you can say about them they've not said When they're alone
Pick up the phone

[Chorus]
I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die
I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die
