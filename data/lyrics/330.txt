[Verse 1]
And I want
And you got it
So much
I'm crazy for

[Chorus]
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!

[Verse 2]
And I'll be good
Like I should
Waiting is such
Misery! I need

[Chorus]
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!

[Verse 3]
A little louder now
I've got to shout it now
Please rush
I need

[Chorus]
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!
Your touch!
