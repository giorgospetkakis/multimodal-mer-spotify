Yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah yeah talkin' 'bout my baby
Talkin' 'bout my baby
When she goes walkin' down Bourbon street
I just can't hardly stand to walk behind her
Shes got her red hot pants on
She got on her yellow high heeled sneakers
She got on a yellow low neck see through blouse
Without her brassiere on
She's shakin' like two big ol' balloons in a hurricane
Ooooh, she's got on a purple afro wig
She got a hand on her hip
Lettin' her back bone slip
Battin' her eye, battin' her eye
Battin' her eye, battin' her eye
Battin' her eye n' lookin' straight at me
Yeah, lookin' straight at me
She's battin' her eyes and lookin' straight at me
With that sassy, saucy look on her face
Shit son, yeah
I want to go out on a picnic with you, baby
Out under the big bright yellow sun
She said "I wanna go out on a picnic with you, baby
Out under the big bright yellow sun"
Under the big bright yellow sun
(repeat to fade out)
