[Long intro]

Well to solve all my problems
To get out of drugs I'd
I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college I'd
Had the earning the money
And the material trip
I just decided I was gonna'
Find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle

Well to solve all my problems
To get out of drugs I'd
I'd had enough of that
I'd had the college I'd
Had the earning the money
And the material trip
I decided I was gonna'
Find a new way of life
And so I took off on my bicycle
Peddling up highway 1
And found myself one day in Eureka California
