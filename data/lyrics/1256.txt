I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
Baby, I just don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
Baby, I just don't have anything, anything
Since I don't have you, I don't have you

I don't have happiness
And I guess I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
Baby, I just don't have anything
Since I don't have you, I don't have you

I don't have happiness
And I guess I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
Baby, I just don't have anything
Since I don't have you
