[Intro]
Uhh, yeah
Oh
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

[Verse 1]
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
But what if it don't?
What happens in my head stays in my head
But sometimes it won't
What if you knew what I was thinkin'?
Would it make you like "Whoa!"?
I don't wanna risk putting my foot in it
So I keep my mouth closed

[Chorus]
All you hear is mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gonna button my lip so the truth don't slip
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out? (Uh-oh)
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see them springing up like daisies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some of my feelings keep escaping
So I make it a joke
Nonchalant, I keep on faking
So my heart don't get broke
I'm in a big, big, big, big, ocean
In a tiny little boat
I'll only put the idea out there
If I know it's gonna float

[Chorus]
All you hear is mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gonna button my lip so the truth don't slip
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out? (Uh-oh)
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see them springing up like daisies

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause in my head, there's a slot machine
And I'm betting you're the one in my hopes and dreams
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la)
(La, la)

[Bridge]
Trust me; it would scare you
If you knew what was going on in my brain
Trust me; it would scare you
That I've picked out the church, all the schools, all the names
If you knew it was all about you
(La, la, la, la, la)
Every wish, every candle, every coin in the fountain
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Trust me; it'd scare you
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la)
(La, la)

[Post-Bridge]
That's why I go
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mmm mm, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
All you hear is mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gonna button my lip so the truth don't slip
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see them springing up like daisies
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gonna button my lip so the truth don't slip
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud? (Uh-oh)
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see them springing up like daisies

[Outro]
Here's one, there's another, oh, oh
There's one
There's a baby, there's one
Babies, babies, babies, babies, babies
I wanna have your babies
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Oh, yeah
Mmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
One day maybe, you'll find out
