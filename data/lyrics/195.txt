My sister's calling with her lovely spell
Her endless passions mean a greatful hell
I'm waving gently to another world
I need her kisses although it hurts

My master is calling - she is calling

She stays my hunger with a burning meal
And I feel shelter in her bloody sea
I call her devil and I call her God
She cures my soul while my senses rot

My master's calling - she is calling

I'm burned by love the heart of earth
While preachers announce he end of the world
A carnal love in the dead of night
My heaven's hell from the other side

My master's calling
