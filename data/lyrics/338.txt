[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so free I could lacerate
Rip the robes right off my chest
I fly high above the Muscovites' sky
I'm gonna rip, rip, I'll never rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna meet you at midnight
I'm gonna meet you at midnight
I'm not used to living alone
I've gotta learn how to live or die

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm so free as I'm naked
Shining silver under the moon
I fly high above the Muscovites' sky
I'm gonna rip, rip, I'll never swoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna meet you at midnight
I'm gonna meet you at midnight
I forget about living alone
As I learn how to live or to die

[Chorus]
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm so free as I meet you
Welcome in black, the queen of the ball
It's dark beneath the Muscovites' sky
But you give, you give me it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here with you at midnight
I'm here with you at midnight
Now I know I'm never alone
As I learn, I learn how to die

[Bridge]
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy

[Chorus]
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
Margarita, love and destroy
