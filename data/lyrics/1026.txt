[Intro]

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet
Mother love ah ha

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

[Verse 3: Brian May]
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

[Outro]
(Mother love, mother love, love, love, love, love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm going back to the things I learned so well in my youth
