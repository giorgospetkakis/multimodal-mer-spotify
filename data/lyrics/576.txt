Wake up, it's all right
You don't have the words, it's okay
I make it worse, if I make it better
I can chase it away
And the emotion running and flapping
Faster and faster, breathing hard
Just for a moment, we're on a breeze
Hold on, hold on tight
You've gone strayed again

Wake up, it's all right
I don't need to know where you've been
Went for a walk, out of my sight

You went astray again

Wake up, it's all right
You don't have the words, that's okay
I make it worse, but I can make it better
Can chase it away
