Bartender another
And make it a double
I can't go home
I'm in some kind of trouble

What started so innocently
Turned to sin
And I can't get out
I am too deep in

Have you ever had everything you'd ever wanted
A good life, good friends and a loving companion
Well take a hard look and pay real close attention
I threw it all away with reckless abandon
On a pair of caramel eyes
I found out how quickly I'd learned to lie

Don't judge me til you've walked a mile in my shoes
Things aren't always as they seem
Cause being with him was like falling asleep
Going home was like waking from some kind of dream
The kind that you hope never ends
But real life is not something I can suspend

Bartender another
And make it a double
I can't go home
I'm in some kind of trouble

What started so innocently
Turned to sin
And I can't get out
I am too deep

Too deep
Too deep
In
