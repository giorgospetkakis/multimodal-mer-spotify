[Verse 1]
It's on your hand
The scratching choices
The streets are shallow
And so were the sounds
Impatient road
Is asking questions
From the hour before this
Before anything

[Chorus]
Fireworks went off that night, Alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky, it's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside
Thinking you and I

[Verse 2]
The tired tongue
Is leaking stories
From a mind's chaotic
Map of the past
Surrender now
You save the clicks and hours
'Cause your sorrow's breaching
In the hours to come

[Chorus]
Fireworks went off that night, Alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky, it's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside
Thinking you and I

[Bridge]
Thinking you and I

[Chorus]
Fireworks went off that night, Alice went home
Dreams exploding in the sky, it's all very strong
There she goes alone, outside, outside
When Alice went home
