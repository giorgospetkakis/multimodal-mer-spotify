[Verse 1]
Educated, with money
He's well dressed, not funny
And not much to say in most conversations
But he'll foot the bill in all situations
'Cause he pays for everything

[Chorus]
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

[Verse 2]
Paper or plastic
Don't matter
She'll have it
Vacations and shopping sprees
These are a few of her favorite things
She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please
His type of girl always comes with a fee
Hey now, there's nothing for free

[Chorus]
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

[Post-Chorus]
And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferraris
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Let's go!
Hey hey!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny

[Post Chorus]
And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferrari's
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money

[Outro]
All of these boys (Yeah) and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys (Yeah) and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys (Yeah) and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys (Yeah) and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
