[Verse 1:]
Seems my life is finally coming together
Feels so good, don't think I've ever been better
It's clear to me
My future will bring
The peace I've been longing for is mine
Forever more

[Chorus:]
It's a new day
(Open my eyes and my path is clearer)
New day
(Pushing ahead till my goal is nearer)
New day
(Spread my wings, I'm doin things my way)
It's a new day

[Verse 2:]
Wasn't sure where I should begin
Couldn't my tell my beginning from the end
For every door that closed, a window opened
Been 'round the world and back again
It starts from within, yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'm excited for the things ahead of me
I've decided I can make it my own
Embrace the good and bad
And let go of the past
I'm loving what's inside of me

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
I decided long ago
I can make it on my own
Gonna be alright, yeah
Gonna be alright, yeah

[Chorus]

Gonna be alright, yeah
