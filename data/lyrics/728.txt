[Verse 1]
We're different colors, and different creeds
And different people, have different needs
It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you, what could I have done?

[Chorus x2]
People are people so why should it be?
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people so why should it be?
You should hate me

[Verse 2]
You're punching and kicking, and you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced, but I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel, from your head to your fist

[Bridge]
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man?
Help me understand

[Chorus x2]
People are people so why should it be?
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people so why should it be?
You should hate me

[Outro]
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man?
Help me understand
