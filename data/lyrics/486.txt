[Verse 1: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
I'm giving up the ghost of love
And a shadow is cast on devotion
She is the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation

[Chorus: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

[Verse 2: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
Bittersweet
I won't give up
I'm possessed by her
I'm bearing a cross
She's turned into my curse

[Chorus: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

[Bridge: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
Bittersweet, I want you
Oh, how I wanted you
And I need you
How I needed you

[Chorus: Ville Valo & Lauri Ylönen]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Bittersweet
