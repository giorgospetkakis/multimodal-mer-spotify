[Verse 1]
One chance to show your face
This one shot all you get
Pass by your one good thing
Lift your head back, shoot and chase

[Pre-Chorus]
Never hear you laugh like that, so full
Not since you were nine

[Chorus]
Unsettled, severing
Always severing old ties
One last good-bye may last the rest of your life

[Verse 2]
Learn your restricted ropes
Paint a cross on your left hand
One good thing signed away
And with it, your only hope

[Pre-Chorus]
Attention focused on today
So quiet, slip behind my back

[Chorus]
Unsettled, severing
Always severing dead ties
One last good-bye may last the rest of your life

[Bridge]
One way trip can work both ways
And loose ends kept untied make better friends
The things you buy may someday leave you

[Outro]
Can you say full ride?
(I still see you)
Can you say?
(I still see you)
Can you say full ride?
(I still see you around)
Can you say?
(Around)
