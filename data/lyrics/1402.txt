It seems like
Out of nowhere
I'm coming apart
Nothing could've saved me
You went straight for my heart

When I've almost had enough
Something about you draws me back again
When I've almost given up
Something about you pulls me in
And we're falling

Feels like
I am reaching
Tryin' to hold on to you
And I know that
There's still hope here
And I know you'll come through

When I've almost had enough
Something about you draws me back again
When I've almost given up
Something about you pulls me in
And we're falling

When I've almost had enough
When I've almost given up
We start falling
And we're falling
