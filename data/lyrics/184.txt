I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say
Yesterday's a day away
Nothing I could do to make it stay like that
Ain't that a fact

I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say
I just can't handle things this way
I know it's late, but I'd like to stay a while
See you smile

Will you meet me in the morning
With the sun fresh on the dew?
Will you meet me in the afternoon
Made just for me and you?
Will you meet me in the evening
When the night-time starts to crawl?
Will you meet me in the hall?
Will you meet me on the wall?
Will you meet me at all?

One more time, one more time
Shaking up and down my spine
Jump a rope or skip a line or two
What can I do?

One more time, one more time
Color flashing neon signs
Advertising a friend of my distraction
Latest attraction

Oh my body has been punished
Lord, I think I've had enough
Oh my body has been punished
With too much and not enough
Oh my body has been punished
And my mind can no longer bluff
My mind is so unkind
My mind is so unkind
It keeps me crying all the time

I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say
Yesterday's a day away
