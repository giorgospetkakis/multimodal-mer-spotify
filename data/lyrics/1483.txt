When you have no one
No one can hurt you
When you have no one
No one can hurt you

In the corners there is light
That is good for you
And behind you, I have warned you
There are awful things

Will you miss me when I burn
And will you eye me with a longing
It is longing that I feel
To be missed or to be real

When you have no one
No one can hurt you
When you have no one
No one can hurt you

Will you miss me when I burn
And will you close the others' eyes
It would be such a favor
If you would blind them

There is absence, there is lack
There are wolves here abound
You will miss me when I turn
Around

When you have no one
No one can hurt you
When you have no one
No one can hurt you
