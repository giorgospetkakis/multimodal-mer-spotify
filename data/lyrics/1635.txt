[Verse 1]
Life is good, I can't complain
I mean, I could, but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good
Good, good
Now I'm rollin' my window down
I love the wind, but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good
It feels good, it feels good

[Chorus]
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holdin' on, white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa, can't believe I'm like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like
Up and down, and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like

[Verse 2]
In the mornin', it begins again
Feels like I'm fallin', better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good
It feels good, it feels good (It feels good)

[Chorus]
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holdin' on, white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa, can't believe I'm like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like
Up and down, and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like
Whoa, whoa, got me feelin' like

[Bridge]
My inhibitions are beginning to let go
In this situation, I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good
I'm holdin' on

[Breakdown]
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
I'm holdin' on
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm running a red light
Like a rocket ship in flight
There's nothin' else that makes me feel like
Whoa

[Interlude: AJ]
Please keep your hands and feet in the ride at all times
Thank you

[Outro]
Like a rollercoaster, whoa
Holdin' on, white knuckles, whoa
Once you let your love in, whoa
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Got me feelin' like (Whoa, whoa)
Got me feelin' like
