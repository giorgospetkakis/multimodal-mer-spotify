This is Dr. Bombay. Doctoro; buy my rice and curry, buy my rice and curry, are good!

My uncle in Bombay
He is very nice
When he's on holiday
I take his field of rice
And open up a store
Like many time before
The best that's found in Calcutta town

Chorus 1

Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Buy my rice and curry!
Buy my rice and curry!
So hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Buy my rice and curry!
Buy one for two!
Special price for you!

I think I have a problem
I really don't know why;
I never have a customer who want to come twice
Although I guarantee
My secret recipe;
The best that's found in Calcutta town

Chorus 2

Oh-eh-oh
Curry nom-nom, curry-curry-curry nom-nom
Oh-eh-oh
Curry nom-nom, curry-curry nom-nom, curry-curry
Oh-eh-oh
Curry nom-nom, curry-curry-curry nom-nom
Oh-eh-oh

The rice is little sticky
And so I got a clue:
If I throw away the curry
I can sell the stuff as glue
Everybody like it;
They like it very much
The best that found in Calcutta town

Chorus 3

Oh-eh-oh
This is Dr. Bombay
Oh-eh-oh
Curry nom-nom, curry-curry nom-nom, curry-curry
Oh-eh-oh
Doctoro; buy my rice and curry (Oh-eh-oh), buy my rice and curry, are good
