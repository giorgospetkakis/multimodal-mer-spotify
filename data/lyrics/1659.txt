[Verse 1]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

[Verse 2]
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see

[Chorus]
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

[Verse 3]
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us?
Simply because our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring understanding here today, Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see

[Chorus]
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
