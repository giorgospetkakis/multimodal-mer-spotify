[Verse 1: Alexis Taylor]
In the privacy of our love
There is nothing outside our love
In the privacy of our love
We're in each other as hand in glove
In the privacy of our love
There is nothing outside, above
If there's nothing outside, above
We're in the privacy of our love

[Verse 2: Joe Goddard]
I've never seen your love again
I'll never be your love for sure
I've never seen your love again
I'll never be your love for sure
I've never seen your love again
I'll never be your love for sure
Except for that day
Except for that day
Except for that day
Except for that day
