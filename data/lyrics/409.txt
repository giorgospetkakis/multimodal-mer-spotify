She's all dressed up... pretty well
Waving your hands so high, she could reach the sky
She is all necked up, like she's got something to sell
But no one cares right now, as she starts to dance

And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah
And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah

She is all fucked up but no one could tell
Living in ages behind to find a brain again
She is all messed up, somewhere up ahead
But no one cares right now, as she starts to dance

And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah
And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah

And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah
And she starts dancing to the music, slowly by my side
And she starts dancing to the music now, yeah

And she starts... dancing to the music, now
And she starts... dancing to the music, yeah
And she starts... dancing to the music, now
And she starts... dancing to the music, yeah
