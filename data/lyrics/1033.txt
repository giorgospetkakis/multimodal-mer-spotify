[Intro]
Hello mate, alright?
Yeah, I'm alright

[Verse 1]
For once in my life I've got somethin' to say
I wanna say it now for now is today
Life has been given to grab and enjoy
So let's all grab and let's all enjoy

[Chorus]
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!

[Verse 2]
Just take a look around you, what do you see?
Kids with feelings like you and me
Understand him and he'll understand you
For you are him and he is you

[Chorus]
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!

[Chorus]
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be rejected
I don't wanna be denied
And it's not my misfortune
That I've opened up your eyes

[Verse 3]
Freedom is given, speak how you feel
I have no freedom, how do you feel?
They can lie to my face but not to my heart
If we stand together it will just be the start

[Chorus]
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
If the kids are united!
They will never be divided!
