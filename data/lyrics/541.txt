One fine day
I'll settle down
When you bloody me
I ran aground
With my broken face
And fisted cuff
Fuck the rest and
All their stuff

I don't anymore
I don't anymore

Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying

Another way
A battle ground
A ready teller whore
Who makes no sound
Keep the money bitch
Keep the stuff
Fly around the world
And keep it up

I don't anymore
I don't anymore

Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying

-Solo-

It's killing time
On the streets
All hate Sunday

Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying
