[Verse 1]
There's an apple in the pussy mouth
Now I am the dinner whore
There's a tumor in the TV mouth
Burn it out before it grows
Someone better get the dog to kick
Jaws wired shut to save the dick
Out of the bottomless pit
Comes the little horn

[Pre-Chorus]
"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"

[Chorus]
The world spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

[Verse 2]
Dead will dance for what is left
The worms will wait with bated breath
"Your blind have now become my deaf"
So says the little horn

[Pre-Chorus]
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself..."

[Chorus]
The world spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

[Bridge]
Everyone will suffer, now
Everyone will suffer, now
Everyone will suffer, now
Everyone will suffer, now
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"

[Chorus]
The world spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar
