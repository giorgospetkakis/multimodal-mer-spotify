Well did you hear, there's a natural order
Those most deserving will end up with the most
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top
Well I say, "Shit floats"

If you thought things had changed
Friend, you better think again
Bluntly put, in the fewest of words
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

Now the working classes are obsolete
They are surplus to society's needs
So let 'em all kill each other
And get it made overseas

That's the word, don't you know
From the guys that's running the show
Let's be perfectly clear boys and girls
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

Ah yeah
Oh yeah

Well feed your children on crayfish and lobster tails
Find a school near the top of the league
In theory I respect your right to exist
I will kill ya if ya' move in next to me

Ah, it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically unjust
Oh, but the takings are up by a third, oh so
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

(Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world)

The free market is perfectly natural
Do you think that I'm some kind of dummy?
It's the ideal way to order the world
"Fuck the morals, does it make any money?"

And if you don't like it, then leave
Or use your right to protest on the street
Yeah use your right, but don't imagine that it's heard
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
