Your love Inferno
Defines your anger
The way you are

My love inferno
Angenlic candle, gelignite
I'll try to cease the burning of you

How can I enjoy your inferno?
Inferno, could you be eternal?
I'll refuse your love

Endless inferno
Reveals your sorrow
For every page
I'll try to break
Your catherine wheel again
