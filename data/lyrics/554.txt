[Intro]
Reverend, Reverend, is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins, an image beneath me
What's within our plans for life, it all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world left in my misery

[Verse 1]
The Reverend he turned to me without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see, I didn't ask him why
I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories now unfold

[Chorus]
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me, some place far abound
I must reverse my life, I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free, belong to me at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Through all those complex years, I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around and make this world my own
And when she died, I should have cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories still remain

[Chorus]
The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery

[Outro]
Gates
