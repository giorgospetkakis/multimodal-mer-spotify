When it rains I don't mind
Let me stand here all night
Did she take her own life
Let me know she's alright

And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And every time it rains
Are the angels crying?

I'll stay strong, I'll be fine
Carry on with my life
I still stare at the sky
Pray for rain, all the time

Why'd you run? Did you hide?
Why'd you leave, no goodbye?
When the clouds take the sky
Does a storm give you life?

And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And every time it rains
Are the angels crying?

And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And every time it rains
All the angels cry for me

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Be the same
Be the same

And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And every time it rains
Are the angels crying?

And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And every time it rains
Are the angels crying?
