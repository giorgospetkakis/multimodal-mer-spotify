Well there are good guys and there are bad guys
And there are crooks and criminals
There are doctors and there are lawyers
And there are folks like you and me

So let's get high while the radio's on
Just relax and sing a song
Drive your car up on the lawn
Let me play your guitar

Well, this here verse is for the people in russia
Though it is a long long ways away
They couldn't hear this song in russia
But couldn't understand the words anyway

So let's get high while the radio's on
Just relax and sing a song
Drive your car up on the lawn
Let me play your guitar

So just be glad you live in america
Just relax and be yourself
Cuz if you didn't live here in america
You'd probably live somewhere else

So let's get high while the radio's on
Just relax and sing a song
Drive your car up on the lawn
Let me play your guitar
