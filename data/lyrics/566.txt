[Verse 1]
Listen to yourself, you're a hot mess
St-t-stutter through your words, breakin' a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess what we both know?
Yeah, I was out of town last weekend
You were feelin' like a pimp 'round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, you got a secret
Whoa, you couldn't keep it
Whoa, somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

[Chorus]
I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
You really shoulda kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You're lookin' like a tool, not a baller
You're actin' like a chick, why bother?
I can find someone way hotter
With a bigger (Wow)
Well...
'Cause on top of all the ways that you've messed up
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut
I'm so sick of it, I've had enough
I hope you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, you got a secret
Whoa, you couldn't keep it
Whoa, somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

[Chorus]
I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
You really shoulda kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
Oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, and then kiss, and then tell, oh
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, and then kiss, and then tell, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, I hope you know, you gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know who or why, you're gross
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go, cause I don't wanna know

[Chorus]
I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
You really shoulda kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh, kiss and tell
Oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh
Kiss and tell, oh-oh-oh
