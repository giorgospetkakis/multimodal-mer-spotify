[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
Everybody can see
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
Go ahead and release
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)

[Verse 1]
You know the music search engine need a tune-up
Soon as they out the gate, they all wanna hear the corner, uh-huh
Well, that was cool, but now, but then, I heard a rumor, uh-huh
Your crew was ridin' for the White Cliffs of Dover, uh-huh
Well, let me tell you how we do it in California
We'll have you on the run just like a puma
If it don't move us, ain't paid ya dues, and it ain't gonna get our roosers
We gonna lose ya to the consumer solution, come on

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
Everybody can see
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
Go ahead and release
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)

[Bridge]
Girl, I want it, you got it
Your body's like a narcotic
The thought is auto-erotic
(Come on and break it on down)
Can I get it on credit?
I guess your brick-house I'll bet it
Take it as far as you let it
(Come on and break it on down)

[Verse 2]
That the spot will get hot
That it's ready to pop
Don't even look at the clock
All of your problems forgotten
It's time to rock 'til you drop
Feel the force and just flock
To the epicenter of the party's bass drummers, come on

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)

[Verse 3]
We gon' stimulate your mind
Everybody's high
Eyes just like a child
Everything feels right
Once you've seen the light
You're gonna move all night
Feel your soul ignite
Everything feels right, right, right

[Verse 5]
We live the masterful life that's mythical
Feel its chords and its vibes atypical
Do what you want
It's alright this mystical time you've got
That's a lot of this principle
If you stay in this moment so critical
Let the music change your brain stem's chemicals
Make you feel like your spirit's invincible
Force centrifugal reaching up to your pinnacle now

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)

[Verse 4]
We rock like Colorado, you're at it throwin' bottles
We give a fuck about your status, who you are tomorrow
Whether you beg or borrow or hit the super lotto
Whether your girl look like a minger or a supermodel
Feel the connectedness, energy, disprojected the weighted
The whole collective consciousness arise like helium up
Groovin' out of the question, won't disrespect him, but
Our style's fuckin' posh like Dave Beckham, come on

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)

[Verse 5]
The truth I'm at 'em and rough 'em
As hard as the granite get
Never hesitant upon a mic strike, quick
Like an avalanche, hijack ya like a Comanche
I'm a man on a mission, rhyme vigilante
Keep all the jealous and the envious antsy
Love to do the club, though, with the party people dancin', uh-huh
And set the mood for all the plottin' and romancin', uh-huh
It's a wonderful night, we got the answer, come on

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful night
You gotta take it from me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
It's a wonderful night
You gotta shake it for me
It's a wonderful night
(Come on and break it on down)
