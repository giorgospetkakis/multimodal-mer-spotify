[Verse 1: Jeremy McKinnon]
And hey darling
I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home till they're singing

[Bridge: Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la la la la
'Til everyone is singing

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'till I get home
Then I swear to you
That we can make this last
If you can wait 'till I get home
Then I swear come tomorrow
This will all be in our past
Well, it might be for the best

[Verse 2: Sierra Kusterbeck]
And hey sweetie
Well, I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't want to be leaving me
Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing

[Bridge2: McKinnon & Kusterbeck]
La, la la la la la la
'Til everyone is singing
La, la la la la la la

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'till I get home
Then I swear to you
That we can make this last
If you can wait 'till I get home
Then I swear come tomorrow
This will all be in our past
Well, it might be for the best

[Verse 3: McKinnon & Kusterbeck]
You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can't wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually

[Outro]
La, la la la la la la
Now everybody's singing
La, la la la la la la
Now everybody's singing
La, la la la la la la
(If you can wait 'till I get home)
Now everybody's singing
La, la la la la la la
(Then I swear we can make this last)
Now everybody's singing
La, la la la la la la (If you can wait 'till i get home)
Now everybody's singing La, la la la la la la
(Then I swear we can make this last)
Now everybody's singing, La
