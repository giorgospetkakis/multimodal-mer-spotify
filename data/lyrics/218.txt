I've tried so hard to remember
What it is that I forgot
But I can, but I can believe
Will you now

I've tried, I've tried, I've tried
Cried and kissed goodbye
To something that we both know
Boy you blow my mind

I don't know how I'm going to
Show you what I feel for you
But all I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

Have you ever tried to be
Have you ever tried to see
Something but you don't really know what it is
Lord but we got to try

I look at you
I hear your voice
I try to remember
I try to remember

So don't you look at me with worried eyes
'Cause you know we got to try girl
All I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

All I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

All I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

Here I am and I believe
Yes I do
What I do, what I do for you
Oh-oh

I look at you
I hear your voice
I try to remember
I try to remember

So don't you look at my with worried eyes
'Cause you know we gotta try girl
All I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

All I know, all I know is I
I wanna be with you

All I know, all I know is I
I gotta be with you
