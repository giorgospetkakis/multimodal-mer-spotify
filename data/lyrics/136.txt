[Verse 1]
Now who, who, who do you think I am?
Well, I built this ark with Japheth, Shem, and Ham
But what, what, what do you think it's gonna do
When I live by faith and now my work is through?

[Chorus]
It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today

[Verse 2]
Now when, when, when I am in doubt
And I think that things for me will never work out
But where, where, where the heart is true
Ya know the Lord, your god, will never forsake you

[Chorus]
It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today

[Verse 1]
Now who, who, who do you think I am?
Well, I built this ark with Japheth, Shem, and Ham
But what, what, what do you think it's gonna do
When I live by faith and now my work is through?


[Chorus]
It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today

Forty days and forty nights (it's gonna rain)
Forty days and forty nights (it's gonna rain)
Hallelujah, it's alright (it's gonna rain)
Everybody's sleepin' tight (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's gonna rain tonight

[Chorus]
It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today

It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today

It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I said it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Yeah, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
I'm so happy to say (it's gonna rain)
Oh, it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
On the world today
