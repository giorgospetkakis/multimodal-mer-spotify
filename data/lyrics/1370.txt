[Verse 1]
Now the fun is over
Where do words begin
I'm trying to find the path ahead
Any way you say it
The charade goes on
But your eyes won't see it
It's the same old song

[Refrain]
I don't believe you
I don't believe you

[Verse 2]
Promises so golden
Years have proved them wrong
I'm trying to leave some self-respect
Any way you say it
Our decline goes on
But your pride won't heed it
It's the same old song

[Refrain]
I don't believe you
I don't believe you, I don't!
I don't believe in you

[Bridge]
And the way you play it
Is the way you want it
Any way you sing it
It's the same old song

[Refrain]
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
