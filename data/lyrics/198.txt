[Verse 1]
I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last
Past Saturday night

And I’d like to know
It’s more than
Love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah
Yeah

I want a
A love that’s on the square
Can’t seem to find somebody
Someone to care

And I’m on a
Lonely road
That leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

[Verse 2]
I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yeah
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I’m hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone
Someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays
And Tuesdays grow cold

Love for all my life
To have and to hold
Oh and I want a
Sunday kind of love

Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah

I don’t want a Monday
Tuesday or Wednesday
Or Thursday, Friday
Or Saturday

Oh, nothing
But Sunday
Oh yeah

I want a Sunday
Sunday
I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah

Sunday, Sunday
Sunday kind of love
