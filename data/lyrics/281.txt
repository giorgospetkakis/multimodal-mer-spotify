Ahh... Go!
The sky is falling it’s a curious condition
It ain’t a fallacy, it ain’t superstition
You live your life like you’re some kind of actor
But this scenario you cannot manufacture

[Hook]
We’re gonna need some action
We’re gonna need some action soon
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It’s all the same, there’s nothing new

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon

Where’d you learn how to be so complacent?
They beat you down and you might as well face it
Your heroes lied, yeah they’re all just a fake
Don’t know how much more of this I can take

We’re gonna need some action
We’re gonna need some action soon
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It’s all the same, there’s nothing new

We’re gonna need some action (We’re gonna need some action)
We’re gonna need some action soon
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It’s all the same, there’s nothing... New!

Ahh... Go!

[Hook x2]
We’re gonna need some action (We’re gonna need some action)
We’re gonna need some action soon
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It’s all the same, there’s nothing new

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Action! Action! Action! Action!
