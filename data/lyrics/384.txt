[Verse 1]
We are damned and we are dead
All god's children to be sent
To our perfect place
In the sun, in the dirt

There's a windshield in my heart
We are bugs so smeared and scarred
Could you stop the meat from thinking
Before I swallow all of it? Could you please

[Chorus]
Put me in the motorcade
Put me in the death parade
Dress me up and take me
Dress me up and make me your dying god

[Verse 2]
Angels with needles poked through our eyes
And let the ugly light of the world in
We were no longer blind
We were no longer blind

[Chorus]
Put me in the motorcade
Put me in the death parade
Dress me up and take me
Dress me up and make me your dying god

[Outro]
Now we hold the "ugly head"
The Mary-whore is at the bed
They've cast the shadow of our perfect death
In the sun and in the dirt
