[Verse 1]
I haven’t written in a minute, just been going through shit
I mean I barely set the mic up, might just hold up that shit
Been getting sick of these phases, don’t relate to what’s current
Getting used to sleeping in, surprised I woke up this morning
Most of the time I’m getting faded, baby
It take a fucking glass of wine to see reflections lately
It seem like I can’t catch a break, but I’m still Gary Payton
It’s just another fucking minute, fuck it, yeah, just play me
Like, put me in, or take me out
But either fucking way you gonna say my name, that shit is too unique
I got a mask all on my face, a couple converse on my feet
And I don’t exhale, I don’t like to breathe much
Used to being in hell, with smoke inside of both lungs
Ain’t nothing but a burnout, y’all just doing donuts
And I don’t need to go outside to see no damn sun
Been staring at it too long, dots all on my retinas
Vision like a buckshot, be careful not to end up
As someone in my crosshairs, you don’t want to cross me
I’ll put you on some skates, I’ll tear out your fucking crossbeam
You running out of options, gouging all them price-tags
Dancing all on TikTok, cause you can’t keep a real job
Guess I’ll just never get it, guess maybe I’m just fake
Cause if that shit is real, then I don’t know a fucking thing
Been trying to get by, but mostly get away
And every single day feels like a hundred fucking days
And look I swear I couldn’t care less, truth is, I just care more
Than most the people I meet, I wonder what they’re here for
A bunch of, “you should do this”
And never, “what do you think?”
Is everyone just brain dead, or scared to form opinions for themselves
They check them timelines, scroll until they find shit
That tells them how they should feel, about some shit that’s pointless
Dawg, I don’t understand it, like, what the hell do you gain?
A couple fucking retweets, you gave yourself a good name?
Dawg, y’all are fucking canceled, I swear I won’t apologize again
Not for a single fucking thing, if you don’t like it, suck a dick
Must be a “you” thing, mind your fucking business
Cause my shit’s always thriving, and yours is on somebody else’s time
And you should clock-in, instead of spewing shit that don’t exist
It’s like some people like to listen just to spin it ’til it fits
And that shit’s funny, really though, that shit it makes me laugh
Cause I already won at life cause no one ever search your ass
But I’m just tired, don’t even feel like finishing this
Cause it’s too easy, and maybe that’s the reason I just
Feel defeated, but lately that’s my motivation
Not taking sides, but if I was I’d pick me every time, yeah, that’s right
Yeah that’s right
Yeah that’s right
Yeah that’s right
Yeah right
