Where are they now?
They are gone
I saw them run
Run to the sea
Under the waves
All has been said
Can you hear them?
Their voices are free
Free from the sun stare
Free from the noise
Of lost souls...

In exiled sound
Washed in with the tide
Their voices are free
Free from the sun stare
Free from the noise
Of lost souls...

Their voice carries life
Under the waves
Under the waves
Their voice carries life
Under the waves
Under the waves
Under the waves
Under the waves...
