You wanna go for a ride
So get in the car
And I won't hurt you
Unless you ask me to
Hurt you

Boy
I won't hurt you
Unless you ask me to
Hurt you
Boy
And take off your clothes

I wanna take pictures of you
I wanna capture you in digital
I wanna take pictures of you

You wanna go for a ride
So get in the car
And I won't touch you there
Unless you ask me to
Touch you there

Boy
I won't touch you there
Unless you ask me to
Touch you there
Boy
And take off your clothes
I wanna take pictures of you
Boy
I wanna capture you in digital
I wanna take pictures of you
Boy

You won't age a day
In freeze frame
You won't age a day
In freeze frame
You won't age a day
In freeze frame

Take off your clothes
I wanna take pictures of you
Boy
I wanna capture you in digital
I wanna take pictures of you
Boy
Take off your clothes
I wanna take pictures of you
Boy
Take off your clothes

(I wanna take pictures of you)
(Boy)
