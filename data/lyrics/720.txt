On the day I was born, the rain came down
And there was trouble brewing in my home town
It was the seventh day, I felt like Satan's son
And I scared the ghost out of everyone

They said stop, and I said go
They said yes, and I said no
They said fast, and I said slow
Slow

Being bad ain't so bad
I've known more pretty women than most men had
So won't you all come along with me
And I'll show you how fun that bad can be

They said right, and I said left
They said East, and I said West
Oh, they said up, and I said down
Down

I tell you a story, it ain't no lie
I was born to love 'til the day I die
So you can line 'em up, I'll knock 'em down
'till they all come tumbling, tumbling down

They said up, and I said down
They said sleep, but I roam
Oh, they said lost, and I said found
Found
