I belong with your arms wrapped around my neck
Your lips glistening in the light
I've seen headlights passing by
Hold the thought
I hold the thought
Walking back towards your house
Rain drops bouncing off the leaves
Down to our September kiss

Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you

If all the words I ever wrote
On the back of envelopes
I could fold into paper planes
I could fly them through your veins
Helicopters overhead
Wide awake at 3am
Now the ink runs to your heart
And you know just how I feel

Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you

Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you

And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
