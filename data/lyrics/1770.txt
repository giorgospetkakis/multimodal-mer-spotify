I left myself
I left my body
I got so frightened by myself
And all the things that I could see
I left myself

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I whispered "no";
To my own shadow
I got so frightened by the light
And all the tings that I could see
I whispered "no";

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I got along
To my own voice
I got enlightened by the fright
And all the things that I could see
I got along

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I flew away...
