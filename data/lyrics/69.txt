I can't take this
Born to break this

She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today

I'm a loner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner in my mind
I'm a bad one
I'm a good one
I'm a sick one with a smile

I can't take this
Born to break this

She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today
