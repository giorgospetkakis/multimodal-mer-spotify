Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Her tears fell on her pages
Found me well on her words
I don't know what to do or say

Wadin' through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
The Tuscarawas flowed into
The Great Lakes

Ridin' back
Where the highway met dead tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
So far away

[Chorus]
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio

Green, green youth:
What about the sweetness we knew?
What about what's good, what's true
From those days?

Can't count to
All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you?
I can't say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

[Chorus]
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio

Children blessed
Gather round the home she rests
So pull and go over there Midwest
Moon and sun

Flashes bringing on
My open eyes to lightnin' storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

Craving dreams
A million miles ago you seem
A star that I just don't see
Anymore

Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along
The way

Sorry for
Never goin' by your door
Never feelin' love like that
Anymore

[Chorus]
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio
