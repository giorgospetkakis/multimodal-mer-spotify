[Verse 1]
Morning calls, darkness draws
Upon this day a shadow falls
Silence warps through the halls
Since I've been gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
A hundred years from today
Lamplights ablaze, pave my way
Til Jesus saves my early grave
I will be gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3]
Drop the anchor, lift my heart
From stem to stern, I'm torn apart
Mount my horse, park my cart
Tomorrow I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 4]
Seek the hull, leave the deck
Silver moon, silhouette
In due time you will forget
That I am gone, gone , gone
Since I've been gone, gone, gone
I will be gone, gone , gone
Tomorrow I'm gone, gone, gone
