[Verse 1]
Mary is my bright red star
She caught the train to work in the morning when she got up
And then she'd call me up, just to wake me up
But she's alright
She's alright

[Verse 2]
Mary is my bright red star
She likes to look at the pink sky just before the day turns dark
And then she'd call me up, just to wind me up
But she's alright
She's alright

[Verse 3]
Mary is my bright red star
She wears a hat in the sun, pink nails and her bleach blond locks
And then she'd call me up, so we could meet up
But she is alright
She's alright

[Verse 4]
Mary is my bright red star
We just talk into the night about nothing in particular
And then she'd hang me up, until she'd wake me up
But she's alright
She's alright
She's alright
She's alright
