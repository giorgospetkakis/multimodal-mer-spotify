"I'd like to thank the guy who wrote the song
That made my baby fall in love with me"

Who put the bomp
In the bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama-lama ding-dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo-bop shoo-bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da-dip da-dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby fall in love with me (Yeah)

When my baby heard
Bomp bah-bah bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp bah
Every word went right into her heart
And when she heard them singin'
Rama lama-lama lama-lama ding-dong
She said we'd never have to part

So who put the bomp
In the bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama-lama ding-dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo-bop shoo-bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da-dip da-dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby fall in love with me (Yeah)

Each time that we're alone
Boogity boogity boogity boogity boogity boogity shoo
Sets my baby's heart all aglow
And every time we dance to
Dip da-dip da-dip, dip da-dip da-dip
She always says she loves me so

So who put the bomp
In the bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama-lama ding-dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo-bop shoo-bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da-dip da-dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby fall in love with me (Yeah)

"Darling, bomp bah-bah bomp, bah-bomp bah-bomp bomp
And, my honey, rama-lama ding-dong forever
And when I say dip-da-dip da-dip da-dip
You know I mean it from the bottom of my boogity boogity boogity shoo"

Bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp
Rama-lama ding-dong
Dip da-dip da-dip
Boogity boogity shoo

Bomp bah-bomp bah-bomp
Rama-lama dingdong
Dip da-dip da-dip
Boogity boogity shoo
