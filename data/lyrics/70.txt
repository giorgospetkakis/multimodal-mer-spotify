Hold on the further waves are high
Sleepless every night
Lie down shading your eyes from everyone

Hey darlin' don't you look fine
So blue all the time
When you're terrified

Over and over the lines
You memorized in time
Now you're so tired
And the telephone's too far away

Phone lives have taken all your time
Taken all this time
For the rest of our lives we're terrified

The photographs they've taken make you look blind
Your costumes made of twine
Now you're forgetting all of your lines again

But hey darlin'
Don't you look fine
Your two front teeth shaved
Like ice and sharp as razors

Hey darlin' don't you look fine
The dull look in your eyes
You're terrified

Holding the hands of our crimes
Darlin' don't you look fine
As brave as we were those days

Doing the best we knew how
On a torn blue foam couch
As brave as we were those days

Holding the hands of our crimes
Darlin' don't you look fine
As brave as we were those days
