If you had not've fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
But I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, but I will stil remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
If you had not've fallen
Than I would not've found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up and your fever down
I know someday that you will fly away
Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, but I will stil remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So fly, fly on past the speed of sound
Ohh, rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to and I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to and I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
