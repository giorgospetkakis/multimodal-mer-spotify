Chairs on an island, candles in a room
He showed her all the things that made a new day new
She kept forgetting but he would help recall
There's more to life than standing when the world wants you to fall

So she needs him badly and now she thinks she's lost
Without the strength he lent, the pillar and the cross
Lies on an island, sleeps in a room
There's no more need for standing when the world won't let you fall

It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?
It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?

You made this too
You made this too
You made this for me alone
You made this too
You made this too
I made you do this to me

It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?
It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?
