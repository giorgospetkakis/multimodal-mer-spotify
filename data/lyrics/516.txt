[Verse 1: Mark King]
How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

[Chorus]
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

[Verse 2: Mark King]
If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

[Pre-Chorus]
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

[Chorus]
Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't be without you
Baby tonight

I know there's something about you
Baby
And I couldn't live without you
Tonight
