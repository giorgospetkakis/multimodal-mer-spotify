[Verse 1]
Under my shirt
Half to a muscling
The tale I've writ on
Each arm's length long

[Verse 2]
It's my belief
Puzzles are tricking me
I lend it out to borrow
Am I to find
My baby's cries

[Chorus]
Laughing on our bed
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head

[Verse 2]
It's my belief
Puzzles are tricking me
I lend it out to borrow
Am I to find
My baby's cries

[Chorus]
Laughing on my bed
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head

I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel, I feel perpetual

[Bridge]
True blue and real
I feel, I feel
True blue and real

[Chorus]
And I feel all of it
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual

True and real
