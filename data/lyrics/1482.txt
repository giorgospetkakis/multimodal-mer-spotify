Staring out, depressed about what words I have to plead
So torn apart
Shattered by impressions of confessions in defeat
My broken heart
Crying, desperate, fighting questions, scared to let go

We used to be so beautiful
But the days go by and things get better
I'm weary from the war, I'm losing half my soul
But the days go by and...

Past the point of reasons I just want you to believe
That it's not your fault
Cry your eyes to sleep, it's like a thousand rainy nights
Oh, drowning lows
Photographs, the close up, what we had come undone

Where did it all go wrong?
The days go by and things get better
You hardened like a stone to face the world alone
But the days go by and things get better
Exhausted of apologies in search of something comforting
But the days go by and things get better
Brought out the best and worst in me, you gave your all unselfishly
But the days go by and...

Oh, I could never replace all the tenderest moments
They will always live right here inside me
My love will forever hold a place for you
That's why I'm so confused, yeah

Girl, we used to be so beautiful
But the days go by and things get better
I'm losing half my soul to face the world alone
But the days go by and things get better
We're not the type to just give up, but I know that it's what's best for us
The days go by and things get better
We'll pass some crossing roads, surviving on our own
But the days go by and...
