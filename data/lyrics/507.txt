I'm not a sailor
I'm not so strong out of my shoes
Dragging like anchors

Over the ocean
Pearls in the sky are strung round the moon
Pointing to you

And I'll sail til morning
Or I'll sail til I
Am carried to you tonight

I'm not a sailor
But I'll spend the night out on the sea
Out on the sea

And I'll sail til morning
Or I'll sail til I
Am carried to you tonight
