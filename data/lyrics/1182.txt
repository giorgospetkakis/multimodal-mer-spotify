Oh
Do you remember
All the seconds
You are awake
Yes
We take a lantern
And we go back
To your place
Oh
I won't abandon
My foolish notion
It's too much fun
Though
You say it's all right
You do not ask me what I've done

Are we
To make an effort
How might I weave it (???)
And count each one
I know
'Cos I can do it
And when I've done it
I will have won
Why
Can't I abandon
I need a random (???)
The wrong idea
I need
To make an edit
I need to change how I appear

I don't doubt
I know you know me
It's about
The words that throw me

Stammer a line
Burn out of change
There's ink on your hands
And a tear on your page
Half-found intentions are met with a frown
The simplest plans can drag you down

I don't doubt
I know you know me
It's about
The words that throw me
I don't doubt
I know you know me
It's about
The words that throw me

Tell me
Why does it matter
If there's no pattern
To what we do
I know
That only logic
When there's magic
Between me and you
All
Of a sudden
Now you are hidden
From my view
How
Do I get you back
And make an old love
New

I don't doubt
I know you know me
It's about
The words that throw me
I don't doubt
I know you know me
It's about
The words that throw me
