[Verse 1]
I never bite off more than I can chew
But then she came and bit me
I never bite off more than I can chew
But then she bit my leg
She said, don't wanna work, I wanna play
And live my life like it was Sunday
The only problem is that Sunday only comes
Now once a week and I'm a freak but

[Pre-Chorus]
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should we stay
A prisoner of today?

[Verse 2]
My body's tired, my soul's excited
And I wish that I was gifted
My body's tired, my soul's excited
And I wish I had some spunk
She said, I wanna run, I wanna hide
And leave this place just like it left me
The only problem is I need to find the balls
To follow through and that's the truth but

[Chorus]
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should we stay
A prisoner of today?
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should I stay
A prisoner of today?
A prisoner of no time for one another
(We're breaking up the city)
No time for one another
(No time for wasting away)
No time for one another
(So tell me, why should I stay)
No time for one another
(A prisoner of today?)

[Bridge]
Cause this our time, this is our time
This is our time and our space
History I, history I
History I can't erase
Cause this our time, this is our time
This is our time and our space
History I, history I
History I can't erase

[Chorus]
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should we stay
A prisoner of today?
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should I stay
A prisoner of today?
We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me, why should I stay
A prisoner of today?
A prisoner of no time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
No time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
No time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
No time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
No time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
No time for one another
(We're prisoners of today)
There's no time for one another!
(We're prisoners of today)
There's no time for one another!
(We're prisoners of today)
