Cry
As much I want to weep
I know I can't have you
I wipe my tears away, away

I try, I try, I try, I try

Wish, wish for the summer
Want, to pull over under
I wipe my tears away, away

I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try to make the best at happiness

I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
My love is bleeding
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
An empty feeling

I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try to make do with much more of less

All, all of our moments have
Just become ailments
I'm haunted all of every day

I try, I try, I try, I try

Ache, aching and teething
My, big love is bleeding
I think I might be dying

I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try to make the best at happiness

I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
My love is bleeding
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
An empty feeling

I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try

I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
My love is bleeding
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
I'm a broken heart
An empty feeling

I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
I try, I try, I try, I try
