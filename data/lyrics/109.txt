[Verse 1]
He said "I'll love you til I die"
She told him "you'll forget in time"
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

[Verse 2]
He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

[Bridge]
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time - he's over her for good

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
