[Intro]
Alright! Everybody now!

[Chorus]
I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need no toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing 'til I got
Blisters on my hand because

[Chorus]
I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Yes, I do)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(That's right)

[Verse 2]
When I get older, they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks were so hot, I made the teacher wanna dance
And that's why

[Chorus]
I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey, why not?)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(I'm gonna bang now)

[Instrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(I can bang that sucker)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(Listen to this)

[Verse 3]
Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated, the boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed
And I pound on that drum like it was the boss' head
Because

[Chorus]
I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Bang! Bang!)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(I can bang that drum)

[Outro]
I don't want to work
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(This is why I bang the drum)

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey, you wanna take a bang at it?)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I don't want to work
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey! Bang!)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(I can do this all day)

I don't want to work...
