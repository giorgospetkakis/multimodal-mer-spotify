How deep is your ocean?
How high is your sky?
I love to put our love into motion
But I have to ask myself why (why?)

I can't tell you how to live your life
But I know how to live mine
I take home pretty things that I like
And, baby, you are so fine
Yeah, I could give you everything you need
With just one touch of my hand
But I swore I would never fall in love
With a boy in a rock and roll band

Why do I adore you?
We've only just met
I feel I would do anything for you
But, baby, sometimes I forget...

That I can't tell you how to live your life
But I know how to live mine
I take home pretty things that I like
And, baby, you are so fine
Yeah, I could give you everything you need
With just one touch of my hand
But I swore I would never fall in love
With a boy in a rock and roll band

Well, I forget I'm a lady
I've had too much wine
I'd love it if you would call me your baby
'Cause, baby, you are so fine

Yeah, I can't tell you how to live your life
But I know how to live mine
I take home pretty things that I like
And, baby, you are so fine
Yeah, I could give you everything you need
With just one touch of my hand
But I swore I would never fall in love
With a boy in a rock and roll band
