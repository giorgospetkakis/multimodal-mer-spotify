[Verse 1]
We're driving
Just me and God
It's raining
It's raining hard
The windows
Are steaming up
The bridge engulfed by fog

The rust of
The metal bridge
It beckons
It pulls me in
I argue
I scream at God
And what he's offering

[Chorus]
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light off
My thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no lighthouse or way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering

[Verse 2]
I'm driving
I talk to God
He's screaming
I only nod
I need to
Be where you are
The leaves and trees are shaking

It's raining
The bullets melt
The hunger
Of hunger itself
It's draining
But pain has reservoirs it keeps for itself

[Chorus]
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light off
My thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no lighthouse or way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering

[Bridge]
I'm falling
I'm not myself
I'm diving
I'm underneath
The hull of
A mighty ship
That steams away from here

The bubbles
The surface race
They shine and
They replicate
I hear it
The Voice of God is laced with sarcasm
In your hands

[Chorus]
And my thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no light
How's the way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light off
