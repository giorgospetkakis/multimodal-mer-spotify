Down at the train they go to Independence every day
But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away
And I must have been high to believe that i would ever leave
Now im just a flat fine line like the Wichita Skyline

I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon
I wished hard enough to hurt, drove fast enough to catch the moon
But i must have been dreamin' again 'cause there's nothing around the bend
Except for that flat fine line, the Wichita skyline

As far as Salina I can get that good station from LaRue
I'm searching the dial while I'm Scanning the sky for a patch of blue
And I watch that black clouds roll in chasing me back again
Back to the Flat Fine Line, the Wichita skyline
