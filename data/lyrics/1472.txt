[Verse 1]
Well, you're a long walk from my street
And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess and everything is so above me
From the floor I found the life I lead today

[Chorus]
Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for the week
They can't make, make, make me forget the weather
If I never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time, then we said goodbye to the beach
We're showing off, we're showing off our teeth

[Verse 2]
So make one last call back home
'Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting
(Tell me, do you feel me?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's singing like we're crazy in love
We made a dizzy mess of everything and it was enough
To bring all the boys and all the girls together

[Chorus]
Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for the week
They can't make, make, make me forget the weather
If I never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time, then we said goodbye to the beach
We're showing off, we're showing off our teeth

[Bridge]
You're going out in style and I'm getting tired
Of all your lying (Tell me do you feel me, listen can you hear it?)
Stop pretending (Cave in and believe me, open up and scream it)
Stop; The answer's in the smile, and I'm coming clean
Just give me something (Tell me do you feel me, listen can you hear it?)
Stop pretending (Cave in and believe me, open up and scream it)

[Chorus/Outro]
Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for the week
They can't make, make, make me forget the weather (Make one last call back home)
If I never, never, never wash the sand from my feet (tonight we go it alone)
It was the very last time, then we said goodbye to the beach (And I hope that you know I'm waiting)
We're showing off, we're showing off our teeth
