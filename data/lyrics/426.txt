When I look in your eyes
I get a feeling that I can't describe
It can't be wrong
No, no
Not when a feelin's comin' on this strong

Now I'm wonderin' why
I feel so good inside
When I look in your eyes

When you tell me your mine
You send a shiver runnin' up and down my spine
Could this be love
Cause you're the girl I've been dreamin' of now

I'm wonderin' why
I feel so good inside
When I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes

When I get you alone
It's so much different from the telephone
Don't let me go
No no
Just want to hold you like I told you so now

I'm wonderin' why
I feel so good inside
When I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes
