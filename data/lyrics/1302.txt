Blue mountain river, if only for a while
Take me to the river, lay down by your side
The world is full of madness and I find it hard to smile
Take me where you're going I 'll be right by your side

Blue mountain river, comfort me a while
I 'll follow down the river, follow you til night
I listen to you whispers, you dance in time to mine
We'll stay awake together watching silver in the sky

Blue mountain river, I wanna rest a while
You're changing my reflection and the seasons in my mind
Let these days go on forever, I 'll leave in my own time
Take me where you're going and I 'll be right by your side

Blue mountain river, I went there for a while
I listened for an answer and I found it deep inside
When I'm lost behind the shadows and I wanna run and hide
My blue mountain river is there right by my side
