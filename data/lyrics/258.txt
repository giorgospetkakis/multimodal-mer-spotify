Here's a song for lazy girls and laid back boys
Who never quite outgrew their toys
Maybe they told you you got to go get 'em but you'd rather lay low and watch the river run

Hey lazy girls and laid back boys
You got it right life's to enjoy
Eating orange popsicles

Float down the road blowin' kisses
Keep laughin' through the hits and misses yeah
Well it's a long trip
You don't need to die young
So get a good grip and keep on having fun

CHORUS

Call me lazy but I'm happy if you're happy you got it all

Here's a song for lazy girls and laid back boys
Eating orange popsicles
