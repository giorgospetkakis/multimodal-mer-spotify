[Chorus]
I will never see the sun
Spadina, St. George, Bay, and Yonge
One for nothing, all for one
Spadina, St. George, Bay and Yonge

Hey you look like royalty
Weren't you born with muddy feet?
Hoarse, in high tops, totally lost
Those two streets will never meet

[Chorus]

So the map says 'you are here'
Waltzing in a garbage pile
Sweating like a weather's vein
Coughing thunder, sneezing rain

[Chorus]

There's a rag just up the street
Eats his history to keep warm
Got some blankets, got some bags
Screams confessions, shouts in vain
