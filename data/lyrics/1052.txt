Sixth and Green is the one place in November
When the air is cold and the leaves blow on the ground
And I don't think that I can even remember
Why it was that I came to this town

'Cause I just wanna be lonely tonight
Just me and my maker in this cold moon light
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, alright

This is me on the eve of an ending
It's what i've known is constant for a year
I'm so scared this pain that I will be sending
Sometimes I just wanna run away in fear

'Cause I just wanna be lonely tonight
Just me and my maker in this cold moon light
Yeah yeah oh yeah alright

I haven't heard your voice in two weeks now
Anticipations been wearing me thin
And I just can't help but wonderin baby if somehow
We can tear these pages out and begin again

'Cause I just wanna be lonely tonight
Just me and my maker in this cold moon light
Yeah I just wanna be lonely tonight
With no one around to see this sight
Of me lying here mmm yeah

'Cause this is the hardest thing i've ever done before
I said this is the hardest thing i've ever done before
I said this is the hardest thing i've ever done before
And I don't wanna be lonely
No, I don't wanna be lonely no more
And I won't be lonely tonight
'Cause my makers callin me
