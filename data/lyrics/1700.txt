Oh what delight to be given the right
To be carefree and gay once again
No longer slinking, respectfully drinking
Like civilized ladies and men

No longer need we miss
A charming scene like this...

In some secluded rendezvous (whoopee, whistle, bang)
That overlooks the avenue (horn noises)
With someone sharing a delightful chat (yickety yickety)
Of this and that with cocktails for two (clink clink)

As we enjoy a cigarette (wheezing cough)
To some exquisite chansonette (fiddle sound)
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
The serviette with cocktails for two (clink clink)

My head may go reeling (slide whistle)
But my heart will be obedient (heartbeat sound)
With intoxicating kisses
For the principal ingredient (pop fizz laugh)

Most any afternoon at five (ting ting ting ting)
We'll be so glad we're both alive (ahhhhh)
Then maybe fortune will complete the plan
That all began with cocktails for two (clink)

(musical interlude with hiccups & other strange noises)

Most any afternoon at five (Sunday to Monday at five)
We'll be so glad we're both alive (we'll be so glad we're alive)
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan (oooh-we-ooh)
That all began with cocktails for two (hic) two (hic) two-we-ooh (hic)
