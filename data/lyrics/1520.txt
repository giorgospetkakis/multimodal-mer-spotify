[Verse 1]
Transient jet lag
Ecto mimed bison
This is the haunt of roulette dares
Ruse of metacarpi
Caveat emptor
To all that enter here

[Bridge 1]
Open wrists talk back again in the wounded of its skin
They'll pinprick the witness in ritual contrition
The AM trinity fell upon asphyxia-derailed
In the rattles of...
Made its way through the tracks of a snail slouching whisper
A half mast commute through umbilical blisters
Specter will lurk, radar has gathered
Midnight nooses from boxcar cadavers

[Chorus]
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is

[Verse 2]
Cranial bleeding
Leeches train the living
Cursed are those who speak its name
Ruse of metacarpi
Caveat emptor

[Chorus]
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is

[Bridge 2]
Rattling the laughter, hinges splintering inside
Bludgeoned to a saddle, rang the cloister bell inside
Oh, oh, oh...
Inside
Inside

[Chorus]
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is
