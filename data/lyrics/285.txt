[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think:
This hurt inside of me ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Outro]
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
