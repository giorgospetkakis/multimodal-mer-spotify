[Verse 1]
The love bug done bit me
Didn't mean for him to get me
Woo, get up in the morning
And I'm filled with desire
No, no, I can't stop the fire
Love is real live wire
Ooh, it's a burning sensation
Far beyond imagination

[Refrain]
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And, baby, I can't scratch it

[Verse 2]
Keeps me sighing, ooh-oo-ooh
Keeps me yearning
No mama can't help me
No daddy can't help me
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out of this situation
Now, when you're ill you take a pill
When you're thirsty, drink your fill
What you gonna do, oh yeah
When love gets a hold, a hold on you

[Refrain]
Love is like an itching in my heart
And, baby, I can't scratch it

[Verse 3]
Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection
And I don't know the correction
Got me rocking and a-reeling
And I can't shake the feeling

[Refrain]
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And, baby, I can't scratch it

[Bridge]
Keeps me silent, keeps me tired
Keeps me yearning, keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing, keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning

[Outro]
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out of this situation
Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
I've been bitten by the love bug
