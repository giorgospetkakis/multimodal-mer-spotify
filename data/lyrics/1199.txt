Only you
Can make me feel
The world can disappear

Only you
Make my heart heal
And make it oh so clear

We can talk in circles
Going round in a million ways
And never understand

'Cause our words are whispers
Hidden up in a distant haze
Like diamonds next to sand

And I don't even know
Just what it's all about
But I get all blissed out
And then I know
It's only you
