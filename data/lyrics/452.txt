It's hard to talk to people who remember what I say
I guess I need an amnesiac priest or something
Or a stranger on a long bus journey to somewhere far away
One day the desert will cover all the earth
With only the wind to sing in the silence
All my secrets buried forever in the blown dust

It seems so simple but they just don't get it
I meant what I said at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast

Nobody has their consciences clean
Loyalty in the end will be enough
This family thicker than blood
The way we grew together, roots twisted together
And everybody thinks what they shouldn't think
Everybody does what they shouldn't do
Everybody wants what they shouldn't want
Hold on to me and I'll hold on to you

Maybe I'm wrong but they just don't get it
I meant what I said just at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast

We spread our mischief with a little glint in the eye
Where there is war we like to bring peace
Where there is peace we want to bring war
Seduce the priests and break it all
But don't ask me to remember

It seems so simple but they just don't get it
