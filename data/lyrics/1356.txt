"Kill everybody in the whole word... Ahaha!"

Verse 1:
'You have --- of sustinence
There will be no oxygen to sustain the flame
There will be no air for your kind to breathe
You will wither and become a thing of the past'

I lie here and burn

Chorus:
[screams]
'Destroying Angel!'

Verse 2:
'You have decayed from within
Your redemption is ---
You have become one with your poison
You will submit to The Destroying Angel'

[Chorus again, then first guitar solo]

[Bridge]
'You have staggered on the brink of reprieve'
But your book, [...?...]

[Chorus, brief solo and final verse ending with]
'Destroying Angel!'
You have staggered on the brink of reprieve
Your book you're freezing hell
