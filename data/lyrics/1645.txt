When the night fall
And the stars shine in silence
The Magic of the woods
Fly across the sad trees...
Is time to dream forever...
In the night of silver tears...

In the distance
You voice will be listen
Rise your eyes
To the faeryland realm

Is time to sing...in the land of dreams...

Dance in the woods
Under the mistical moon
Feel the embrace
Of the mother earth...

Is time to sing...in the land of dreams...
Is time to cry...for the lost innocence...

Beyond the old forest
A magic secret garden
Live enchanted
For you
Look at the mirror of your heart
And walk behind the gates
Of the eternal morning...
Forever...

In the distance
Your voice will be listen
Rise your eyes
To the faeryland realm

Is time to sing...in the land of dreams...
Is time to cry...for the lost innocence...
