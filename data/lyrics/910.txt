We were giving up time
We were giving on back on all that's left to do
Sometimes you'll have to do
Sometimes there's nothing left to say

We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Rope busted and disgusted
And all we knew we cared

But it always, comes back to this
Yes it always, comes back to this again

We were kicking around
We were broken up bound and everything fell to fear
Sometimes you can relate
Sometimes there's nothing left to say

We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Tongue tied and divided
The wounds just couldn't be found

It always, comes back to this
Yes it always

Six feet below, a world flooded free
How should i know, so far from me
(i) could try for more, i could settle up for less
I'm not keeping score, (i) don't expect you to confess
One side is made, the other side too soon
I flip a coin, there's more sides than two
Trouble ahead, but there's just no going back
I pray for rain, while the water's rising fast

And it always
Oh it always, comes back to this
