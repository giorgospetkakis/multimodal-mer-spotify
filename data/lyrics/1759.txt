Cold in the Sun
My feet on the ground
A pale windless city
A numbness for sound

I'll wait, back here
Or will you notice
A moment in time
A photograph lost here
Since you were mine
I'll wait back here
Or should I start pushing my way back
Yeah...
Should I start pushing my way back

I walk past your room
A deep silhouette
You're tired of racing
I dont understand

I'll wait, back here
Cold and beneath me

A soaked cigarette
I'm asleep on a shoulder that I've never met
I'll wait back here
Or should I, start pushing my way back
Yeah...
Should I start pushing my way
Home

And I'm with all these women
And I'm on the edge of my breath
Ohh...
And I'm thinking of leaving
I could just lay down
Lay down and freeze to death
Yeah.....Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ohhh....

Cold in the Sun
My feet on the ground
A pale windless city
A numbness for sound
