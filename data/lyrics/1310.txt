Baby I just want you to understand
Just exactly how you make me feel
Ooo, oo yeah
I want to feel you next to me, oooo

Time after time, when I'm feelin' low
Something inside of me, lets me know
It's alright, love's on my side
When the world, seems a lonely place
I've got a dream that won't leave a trace, of the blues
I just think of you, baby I know

[Chorus]
I've got a real thing, here by my side
Someone who needs me, holding me tight
And these special feelings, won't ever fade
Cause I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on my heart

Baby our love's, like a melody
Playing for us in the sweetest key
You could find, the music of life
And when we touch
There's the warmest glow
Heat in the passion that heaven knows, is a dream
Just for you, you and me
And baby I know

[Chorus]
I've got a real love, yes I do
And you're someone baby, you're someone baby
You're someone that needs a true love
And these, these special feelings, time can't erase
Baby, believe me
This is a dream and suga
I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on my me, ooo, you got through to my heart, yeah
You got through to my heart baby, oh yeah

Baby can't you see, you and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me (Hold me baby)
Put your hand in mine, love me 'til the end of time
Hold me, love me (Hold me baby, and don't let go)

Baby can't you see, you and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me (I want you to touch me the right way)
Put your hand in mine, love me till the end of time
Hold me, love me

Hold me, love me
(I want you right here, right now, lay by my side, suga thrill me tonight)
Hold me, love me (I want to feel you in my arms babe)

Baby can't you see, you and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me (Oh and you know, when I love, when you're lovin' me)
Put your hand in mine, love me til the end of time
Hold me, love me

(Mmm, come closer)
Baby can't you see, you and I were meant to be
Hold me, love me
(I want to feel your body pressed against mine)
Put your hand in mine, love me til the end of time
Hold me, love me
(Mm, that's right, right there, oh)
