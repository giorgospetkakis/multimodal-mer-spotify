[Verse]
Give me a reason to stay constantly ignored
Give me an angle that I haven't tried before
A guarantee for being honestly compaired
You want to live when life is achingly unfair

[Verse]
Don't make a move, you'll look ridiculous again
We share no interest but it's easy to pretend
Don't start the action, it will turn against you soon
No one is going to follow and you'll stand there like a fool

[Bridge]
You left the people when the people left you out
Back in the suburbs you're craving for the crowd
Only minded now with defeats of yesterday
The mantra spinning in your head will keep it raised

[Verse]
Give me a reason to stay constantly ignored
(I don't think I can)
Give me an angle that I haven't tried before
(Not from where I stand)
A guarantee for being honestly compaired
(Could not be found)
You want to live when life is achingly unfair
(Stick around)

Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up
