[Verse 1]
One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbour called Peter
And a flux capacitor

[Hook]
He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
He said "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine"

Is pretty fine

[Verse 2]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Triple breasted women swim around town
Totally naked!

[Hook]
We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine
Is pretty fine

[Bridge]
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Michael Jackson
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
Seventh album, seventh album...

[Hook]
He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
(great granddaughter)
Is pretty fine

She's pretty fine

Hey hey hey

[Chorus]
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine

Oooooooohhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
He said "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine"
She is pretty fine

[Outro]
He said "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine"
