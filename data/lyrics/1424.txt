[Instrumental Intro]

Hey, look around you - everything's helter-skelter
Listen up, I warn you - run for cover, run
Bang, it happened - time's up, Armageddon
Fire, meltdown - the sky is crumbling in

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

Escape, you're joking - can't find no place to run
Hair is burning, my flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling, taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming, welcome it with a smile

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

"Something's under my skin. Something's very strange, playing with my mind, tempting me to do you in."

Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in a spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never-ending, 'til the black curtain falls

[Instrumental Break]

Snakes surround me, offering their death kiss to me
Down, I'm drowning - how long?, I hold my breath
Dogs are chasing, my legs are paralysed
Pray, don't find me - my life is fading fast

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains
