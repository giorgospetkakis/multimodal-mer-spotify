[Intro: Tom DeLonge (Mark Hoppus)]
(So sorry it's over)
(So sorry it's over)
(So sorry it's over) There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over) There's so much more that I needed and
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fucking useless

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars, put on your game face
Left you in the bar to try and save face

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

[Bridge: Tom DeLonge (Mark Hoppus)]
(So sorry it's over)
(So sorry it's over)
(So sorry it's over) There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over) There's so much more that I needed and
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend, best of intentions I found
Tight-lipped procrastination, yeah later, see you around
