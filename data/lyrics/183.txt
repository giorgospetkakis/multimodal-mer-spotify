I have an evil plan to save the world for every man
And I think it's better than the way it's being run
Oh the groundwork's laid
No, don't be afraid
I'm sure that I can fix it
When I figure out the physics

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

I have an evil plan
To save the world you understand
The exemplary feat
You'd think I'd have to cheat
I'd make Voltaire proud
Deep and furrow browed
Uncanny and so clever
It's "Our Newest Plan Ever!"

Got tired of whining
A grander scheme with silver lining
For every boy and girl
We can't be responsible
For all that's wrong with this world

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

Starving children in pain
You can't believe in that god
The world's not spinning your way
Does every dog still have his day?

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history, yeah
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

Yeah
