The Bala Bay Inn was built in 1910
Not much has changed in this hotel
People still come by to dance, dine and sing
And remember Louis Riel
Rowboats on the water
Wave to the train passing by
Steamships and planes
Will never stop here again
But I hope that I will sometime
Rowboats on the water
Wave to the trains passing by
Steamships and planes
May never stop here again
But I hope that I do sometime


If you're smokin' that shit
You better get your mind right
