[Intro]
Jimmy gone M.I.A
Come back Jimmy

[Verse 1]
When you go Rwanda, Congo
Take me on your genocide tour
Take me on a truck to Darfur
Take me where you would go
Got static on the satellite phone
Got to get you safe at home
Gonna get you somewhere warm
So you get me all alone

[Chorus]
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja

[Verse 2]
Time and time and time and time again
You keep pushing that button but I don't know what you're saying
Hit me on AIM, tryna flip me on some game
Are you coming, are you going, are you leaving, are you staying?

[Bridge]
You tell me that you're busy
Your loving gets me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me
You told me that you're busy (Jimmy)
Your loving gets me crazy (Aaja)
I know that you hear me (Jimmy)
Start acting like you want me (Aaja)

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time again
You keep pushing me, what are you saying?
Ya hit me on AIM and flip me some game
And I still don't know what you're saying

[Bridge]
You told me that you're busy
Your loving gets me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me
You told me that you're busy (Jimmy)
Your loving gets me crazy (Aaja)
I know that you hear me (Jimmy)
Start acting like you want me (Aaja)

[Chorus]
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja
Jimmy, aaja

[Outro]
Jimmy, I love you
Hear me sing
