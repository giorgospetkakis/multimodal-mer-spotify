[Verse 1]
You can't escape now
I've got you locked inside this room
You know I tip good
And soon, you will love me too

Don't be upset now
You know that I get angry too
Don't make me hurt you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's true
No one hears you in this room
(No one hears you in this room)

[Chorus x2]
This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up, baby
Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on
The camera's on

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a changed man
But as a boy I was so true
The world can't protect you
It's true
Not like money will
You want some bread now?
Just promise me
You'll never make me believe you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's true
No one hears you in this room
(No one hears you in this room)

[Chorus x4]
This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up, baby
Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on
The camera's on
This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up, baby
Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on
The camera's on
This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up, baby
Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on
The camera's on
This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up, baby
Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on
The camera's on
