Everything that we make
Has long been overrun
Thought our love could be safe
But know now I was wrong

I tried and tried and tried again
Cos honey now I had a long day in the sun

And baby now it's over
And nothing can be done
And nothing can be done

I cried and cried and cried again
I swore you were the one
But baby now it's over
And nothing can be done
And nothing can be done

So run and tell your mamma
And run and tell your friends
But baby now it's over
And this is where it ends

I cried and cried and cried again

Honey now it's over
And nothing can be done
And nothing can be done
