Call my friends
To share some wine
To share some laughs
And last goodbyes
My photographs
Of these years
Will make me laugh
Through the tears

And what are the odds?
What are the odds this ends and we don't meet again?
What are the odds?
What are the odds that I will miss your smile?

Take a while, take a while
Take care and
Fly away and see the world
Take a while, take a while
Take time and
If you need rest I'll keep your nest
Changeless

Let fondness be our souvenir
To keep it warm it we'll keep it near
Otherwise with no heart to recall
A memory's just a memory after all

I will not leave this pulse alone
Thought it may take the long way home
I will not wait til the end
For my applause for you my friend

And what are the odds?
What are the odds this ends and we don't meet again?
What are the odds?
What are the odds that I will miss your smile?

Take a while, take a while
Take care and
Fly away and see the world
Take a while, take a while
Take time and
If you need rest I'll keep your nest
Changeless
