[Verse 1]
One, one perfect lie
Was it told too soon and
One, one perfect life
Turned to stone cold mercy

[Chorus]
I kneel down by your grave
I kneel down torn and guilty

[Verse 2]
Did I let you down
Say goodbye too soon and
Did you understand my mistake?
Forgive me

[Chorus]
I kneel down by your side
I kneel down scared and helpless

[Bridge]
One perfect lie wrapped in kindness and tears
I wish I believed in your heaven
One perfect life led by blind faith and trust
If God has a heart he will find you

[Outro]
Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
Torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
