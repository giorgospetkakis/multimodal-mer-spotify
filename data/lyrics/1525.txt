I'm looking through new eyes again
Another turn through a wrap around bend
Another fiction about the end
Another heel I have to mend

What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
Afraid that it hurts just to feel

The headlights behind you are always too bright
The road ain't the same and the bitterness bites
Kiss of a stranger
Another trance of circumstance
Another girl a dime a dance
Hidden danger

What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
Afraid that it hurts just to feel

Lessons of the past get all confused
All the stories that I've ever used
Captor of my true desire
Master of my inner choir
I got to know - Won't you tell me

What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
What's the deal
Afraid that it hurts just to feel
Afraid that it hurts just to feel

A dream is true
A dream is true romance

Oh what's the deal
Oh what's the deal
Afraid that it hurts
Just to feel...
Afraid...
Just to feel...
Just to feel...
Just to feel...
