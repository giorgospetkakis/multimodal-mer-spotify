I've been gone away
But I'm back again...back with all my friends
I've been floatin' away
On a silver cloud...lined with all my wildest dreams

Chorus:
I'm back in your system now
And I've waited much too long (back in your system)
And I'm back in your system now
And I've finally come back home

I've been thinking of days
Back when we began...when we first made our first stand
And i get taken away
On a silver cloud...lined with all my wildest dreams

Chorus:
Im back in your system now
And I've waited much too long
And I'm back in your system now
And I've finally come back home

IM BACK INTO YOUR SYSTEM!
There's a way to find it, (repeat 3x)
There's a way to see it. (repeat 3x)
There's a way to get BACK INTO YOUR SYSTEM (repeat 3x)
SYSTEM!

My minds set

Chorus:(repeat 3x)
Im back in your system now
I've waited for much too long
Im back in your system now
And I've found my way back home

IM BACK IN YOUR SYSTEM
There's way to find it
There's a way to see it
There's a way to get BACK INTO YOUR SYSTEM
SYSTEM!
