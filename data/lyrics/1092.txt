Some are reaching few are there
Wandering from a heros chair
Some are scared to fly so high
Well this is how we have to try
Have no envy and no fear
Have no envy
No fear
Brother, brother we all see
You're hiding out so painfully
See yourself come out to play
A lovers rain will wash away
Your envy and your fear
So have no envy
No fear
When your sister turns to leave
Only when she's most in need
Take away the cause of pain
By showing her we're all the same
Have no envy
No fear
Have no envy
And no fear
Every day we try to find
We search our hearts and our minds
The place we used to call our home
Can't be found when we're alone
So have no envy
No fear
Have no envy
No fear
