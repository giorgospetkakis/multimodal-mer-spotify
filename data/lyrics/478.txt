[Chorus]
Everybody, it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody, ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing

[Verse 1]
Ain't it true there's just no doubt
There's some things that you can do without
And that's good

Ain't it true as the sun that shines
You got yours, and you got mine
And that's good

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's just like you, it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

[Chorus]
Everybody, it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody, ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing

[Verse 2]
Ain't it true there's room for doubt
Maybe some things that you can do without
And that's good

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's just like you, it's true
Everybody wants a good thing, too

[Bridge]
Now let's have a great big hand
For everybody that can understand
Life's a bee without a buzz
It's going great 'til you get stung
And let us not forget to toast
Everyone who might've missed the boat
And to everybody else who waits
'til the next one sails in again

[Outro]
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true, it's a monumental good thing
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true, it's a monumental good thing
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true, it's a monumental good thing
