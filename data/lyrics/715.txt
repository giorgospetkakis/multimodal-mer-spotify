We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountain
We've been 'round the fire

In fancy hotels
Drank water from farm wells
We sang with the choir

I kissed your dry lips
We jumped off the high cliffs
And splashed down below

Skin to skin
In the salty river
Made love in the shadows
Woooah ooh

Read books to each other
Read the mind of the other
Flew 1,000 jets

We laughed and we cried
At movies and real life
And our ridiculous bets

We danced in the moonlight at midnight
We pressed against back doors and wood floors
And you never faked it

Infrequently
We ignored our love
But we could never mistake it
Oooh ooh

We met on the front porch
Fell in love on the phone
Without the physical wreck

You gave me the necklace
That used to hang
Around your mother's neck

We questioned religions
Gave bread to the pigeons
We learned how to pray

We stood by the ocean
Turned our hearts into one
We layed in bed all day
Heeey

We skipped on the sidewalk
Skipped stones on the water
Skipped town

We've seen the sunrise with new eyes
We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies
We've seen the sun go down

Had passionate make outs
And passionate freak outs
We built this world of our own

It was in the back of a taxi
When you told me you loved me
And that I wasn't alone
