[Verse 1]
How did she fall in love
Tired and shaken up?
Could it be hangin' around's enough?
No one was foolin' when they told about the sense and sensibility
In movin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fail when you found that you paid the price?
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly
Oh, you cried endlessly

[Chorus]
Take a message for my love (take a message) (8x)

What could I say to you (oh)
When makin' the waves was left unconscious
I didn't mean to tell you why, oh, why
But you harboured all defenses
And you're makin' it hard to bring that hope back
For you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fail when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly
Oh, you cried endlessly

[Chorus]
Take a message for my love (take a message) (8x)

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fall when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly
Oh, you cried endlessly

[Chorus]
Take a message for my love (take a message) (8x)

[Fade out]
