I've been searching for a reason
And I'm running out of time
I can feel that it's the season
It's time to make up my mind

And I can't really tell you what I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down and one road to choose
So I'm thinking over the things that you've said
Thinking over the things...

I'm thinking over
Thinking over
Thinking over
The things that you've said
And I'm thinking over
Thinking over
Thinking over the things...

Am I ready for forever?
Oh, God, show me a sign
'Cause if we're to be together
Then it's got to be divine

And I can't really tell you what I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down and one road to choose
So I'm thinking over the things that you've said
Thinking over the things...

I'm thinking over
Thinking over
Thinking over
The things that you've said
And I'm thinking over
Thinking over
Thinking over the things...

He wants to marry me
Carry me far away
He wants to love me for life
He wants to be with me
Every morning I awake
He wants to hold me through the night

Father, which way should I go?
I cannot clearly see
Oh, I love him so
But only you know if he's the one for me

Thinking over
The things that you've said
I'm thinking over
Thinking over
Only you know if he's the one for me

I can't really tell you
What I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down
And one road to choose
So I'm thinking over
The things that you've said

Thinking over
Thinking over
