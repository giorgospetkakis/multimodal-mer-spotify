[Verse 1]
Never again
On your force-fed illusions to choke
You feed off my pain
Feed off my life

[Bridge]
There won't be another dawn
We will reap as we have sown

[Verse 2]
Always the same
My tired eyes have seen enough
Of all your lies
My hate is blind

[Chorus]
Slaughter of the soul
Suicidal final art
Children, born of sin
Tear your soul apart

[Verse 3]
Never again
My tired eyes have seen enough
Of all your lies
My hate is blind

[Chorus]

[Unsung Outro]
Men must attempt to develop in themselves and their children
Liberation from the sense of self
Men must be free from boundaries, patterns and consistencies
In order to be free to think, feel and create in new ways
