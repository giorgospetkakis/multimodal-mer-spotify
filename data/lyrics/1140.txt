Everbody online?

It's the beginning of the end
You want things to kill faster
It's the beginning of the end
Now everything's too slow for you
It's the beginning of the end
You are one step closer
It's the beginning of the end
Say Amen

1-800-SUICIDE
Or maybe Doctor Online could help you die
You need wings to fly
You need someone to take your place
When you are gone

It's the beginning of the end
You know nothing lasts forever
A beginning of a trend
You need someone there to care for you
It's the beginning of the end
I don't think you understand 
Just a beginning of a flat line
Together
