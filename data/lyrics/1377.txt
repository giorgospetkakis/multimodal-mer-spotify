I heard that now you're callin'
Left it all behind this mornin'
With those blocks, the ones that you see through

Like all the times before
You made sure that they saw you
But now you're gonna see this through

When you look down
You know you'll see this glory verse
What you found
You'll tend to me as glory verse

This world could get you closer
To what you need the most
You'll find this chemistry could move

These sounds will never leave you
Will be there to recieve you
These sounds, they seem to write themselves

When you look down
You know you'll see this glory verse
What you found
You'll tell to me is glory verse

Before you leave from here
Before you leave from here
Here is really just a matter of time
Before it happens, yeah
