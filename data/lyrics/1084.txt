I pray you'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Let this be our prayer
As we go our way
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

I pray we'll find your light
And hold it in our hearts
When stars go out each night
Remind us where you are

Let this be our prayer
When shadows fill our day

Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
Ooooh ooooh
Ooooh ooooh

(We ask that life be kind)
We ask that life be kind
(And watch us from above)
And watch us from above
(We hope each soul will find)
We hope each soul will find
(Another soul to love)
Another soul to love

Let this be our prayer
Just like every child
Needs to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Need to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
