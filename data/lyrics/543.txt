[Verse 1]
You took your love away too fast
Left no chance to say, "Look back"
And now I know the truth, it makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

[Verse 2]
You threw it all away
So blind (So blind)
You pushed me far from you in your life
Now I know the tears won’t lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

[Outro]
Let's pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
