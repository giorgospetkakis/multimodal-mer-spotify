[Verse 1]
It's a strange day
No colours or shapes
No sound in my head
I forget who I am
When I'm with you
There's no reason
There's no sense
I'm not supposed to feel
I forget who I am
I forget

[Chorus]
Fascist baby
Utopia, utopia

[Verse 2]
My dog needs new ears
Make his eyes see forever
Make him live like me
Again and again

[Chorus]
Fascist baby
Utopia, utopia

[Bridge]
I'm wired to the world
That's how I know everything
I'm superbrain
That's how they made me

[Chorus]
Fascist baby
Utopia, utopia
