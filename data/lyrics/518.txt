I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile again

I still reach for the stars, but all I touch is my horizon
I still believe my eyes, but all I see is my blindness
I still reach for the stars, but all I touch is my horizon
I still believe my ears, but all I hear is lasting silence

Like a disciple of a witness
I judge upon my sacred eye
Still I found the origin
In what's left of me inside

Can I call this my burden
Or is this just my dream to fly?
I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile again

Weaker, weaker every day
I forgot my urge to fly away

And is my life as bare as it is?
Cold and lonely enough?
Have you achieved what you were longing for?
Sad enough this cannot be undone

I drop my eyes and shiver as I see
The reflection in the mirror of me

Have you given up, my friend?
Forgiveness be mine

I still reach for the stars, but all I touch is my horizon
Can I call this my burden
Or is this just my dream to fly?
I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile again
