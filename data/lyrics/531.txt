[Verse 1]
Sunshine, won't you be my mother
Sunshine, come and help me sing
My heart is darker than these oceans
My heart is frozen underneath

[Chorus]
We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine

[Verse 2]
Oh Lord, why did You forsake me?
Oh Lord, don't be far away, away
Storm clouds gathering beside me
Please Lord, don't look the other way

[Chorus]
I'm a crooked soul trying to stay up straight
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah shine on me
Yeah, yeah shine on me
Yeah, yeah shine on me
Yeah, yeah shine on me

[Chorus]
Crooked souls trying to stay up straight
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah shine on me
Yeah, yeah shine on me
Yeah, yeah shine on me

[Outro]
Shine on me
Let my shadows prove the sunshine
