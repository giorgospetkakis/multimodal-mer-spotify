[Verse 1]
I stole the keys to the skies
And we'll leave this place for the final time
No crying words, no goodbyes
Yet tonight we're burning all the dark times
Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time, fight fire with fire
'Cause, baby, tonight the world belongs to you and I

[Chorus]
This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
Under the city
Under the city lights

[Verse 2]
Don't tell the world what we've known
We've come so far, but there's still a way to go
It's dark, there's no need for light
When the fire in his eyes is so bright

[Chorus]
This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
Under the city
Under the city lights

[Bridge]
Tonight, turn out the lights
Don't wait, too late to die
Look out, hold on, hold tight
Tonight, alright, I'm getting ready so

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
This boy's in love

[Verse 3]
This town, these streets, your friends
We'll never see this place again
They'll think about you now and then
They'll never see our faces again
Goodbye this town, these streets, your friends
We'll never see this place again
They'll think about you now and then
They'll never see our faces again
