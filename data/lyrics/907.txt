Don't look back just go away, save your threats for another day. I gave it all for a glimmer of hope, I showed you love now I'm your joke. Just fucking choke

One more time I'm left broken
One more time words unspoken
One more time emptiness inside
One more time I'm living a lie

Wasted time is all I have left, the broken promises I kept. Oblivious to you, oblivious to me you can't handle reality

One more time I'm left broken
One more time words unspoken
One more time emptiness inside
One more time I'm living a lie
You - will never fade away
