[Verse 1: Nadine, Kimberley &  Cheryl]
Your eyes, tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus: Nadine & Nicola (All)]
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more

[Chorus: All (Nadine)]
Then, Jump!
For my love
Jump in!
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump for my love
I know my heart can make you happy
(I know my heart can make you happy)
Jump in!
You know these arms can feel you up
(You know these arms can feel you up)
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump! For my love

[Verse 2: Nadine & Cheryl]
You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try
And go much farther, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus: Nadine & Nicola (All)]
You are the one, you, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more

[Chorus: All (Nadine)]
Then, Jump!
For my love
Jump in!
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump for my love
I know my heart can make you happy
(I know my heart can make you happy)
Jump in!
You know these arms can feel you up
(You know these arms can feel you up)
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump! For my love

[Bridge: Kimberley, Nadine & Nicola]
When you are next to me, (Oooo)
Oh I come alive (yeah)
Your love burns inside (Oooo)
Oh, it feels so right (Yeah)
Come to me if you want me tonight (Jump)

[Outro: All (Nadine)]
I know my heart can make you happy
(I know my heart can make you happy)
Jump in!
You know these arms can feel you up
(You know these arms can feel you up)
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump! For my love
