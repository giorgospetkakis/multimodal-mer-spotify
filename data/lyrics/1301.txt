[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
She's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start
But you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot
To show you what I've got

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But it's too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I held your hand (Ah, ah)
It felt like a movie
I made some plans (Ah, ah)
But you were already moving on now
I'm stuck under a rainy cloud
But you don't seem to care
But it's alright 'cause it's

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf, yeah
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I'm tired of wastin' all my time
My heart is hangin' on the line
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Everybody
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else, yeah
Woo, ooh
