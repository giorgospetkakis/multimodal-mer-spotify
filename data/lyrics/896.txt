[Intro: Ginger & All]
You know I don't wanna know
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing

[Verse 1: Baby]
Been broken-hearted before, oh
But that's the last time it happens to me, yeah
I keep on giving, still you're asking for more
Too much emotion, baby, why can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus: Posh, (All), Scary & Ginger]
I'm not afraid of your love (not afraid of your love)
Why can't you see I've had my share of that?
You're what I want, boy
You know you got it, boy
You gotta want me
Just what I need
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact

[Chorus: All & (Scary)]
There's no room for lovin'
Stop that push and shovin', yeah
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

[Verse 2: Sporty & All]
Now, don't go wasting my time, no (wasting my time)
You're not the only thing I've got on my mind
My friends are with me when you ain't been around
Your precious words and promises ain't bringing me down

[Pre-Chorus: Posh, (All), Scary & Ginger]
I've got some living to do (got some living to do)
But don't assume I'm gonna be with you
You're what I want, boy
You know you got it, boy
You gotta want me
Just what I need
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact

[Chorus: All]
There's no room for lovin'
Stop that push and shovin', yeah
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing

[Bridge: Ginger, Scary & Both]
Stop pushin'
You're rushin'
You're losin' my lovin'
I hope it
I see it
Just play it
You feel it
Gotta be bold
Bold and oh so strong
Get with this, then you got it goin' on
On and on with the girls named Spice
You wanna get with us, then you'd better think twice
God help the mister
Yeah, God help the mister
That comes between me and my sisters

[Pre-Chorus: Posh, (All), Scary & Ginger]
I'm not afraid of your love (not afraid of your love)
Why can't you see I've had my share of that?
You're what I want, boy
You know you got it, boy
You gotta want me
Just what I need
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact

[Chorus: All]
There's no room for lovin'
Stop that push and shovin', yeah
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing
There's no room for lovin'
Stop that push and shovin', yeah
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing
There's no room for lovin'
Stop that push and shovin', yeah
Don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing
You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing
