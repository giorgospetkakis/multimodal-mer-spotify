[Verse 1]
Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

[Verse 2]
How to tell you, girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I want to make you understand
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

[Verse 3]
That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

[Bridge]
And the Porter tune (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone

[Chorus]
Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

[Verse 1]
Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

[Verse 4]
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

[Chorus]
Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing
