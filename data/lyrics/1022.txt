[Verse 1]
Love's incentives understood
Irregular thoughts comply
And still afraid of every word
Love is unsatisfied
Zero down to zero
Submerging in every man
Zero down to zero
Catch me as best you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you must know something
'Cause we're dying of admiration here

[Chorus]
Mastering obscure alternatives

[Verse 2]
Between the dialogue, lovers run
New decisions we won't decide
And still afraid of every word
Love remains unsatisfied
Zero down to zero
Submerging in every man
Zero down to zero
Catch me as best you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you must know something
'Cause we're dying of admiration here

[Chorus]
Mastering obscure alternatives
Mastering obscure alternatives

[Outro]
Zero down to zero
Zero down to zero
Zero down to zero
Zero down to zero
Zero down to zero
Zero down to zero

[Instrumental]
