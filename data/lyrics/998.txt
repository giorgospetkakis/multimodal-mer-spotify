[Verse 1]
Well, I said the night you left me nothin' worse could ever happen
Seein' you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons I had for hangin' on

[Chorus]
I'd be better off in a pine box on a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the gray walls of a prison doin' time
I think I'd rather die and go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

[Verse 2]
I always thought that someday we might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way you held onto each other
It was all that I could do not to break right down and cry

[Chorus]
I'd be better off in a pine box on a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the gray walls of a prison doin' time
I think I'd rather die and go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

[Chorus]
Girl, I'd be better off in a pine box on a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doin' time
I think I'd rather die and go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

[Outro]
I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind
