[Verse 1]
Hey now girl what's the matter with me
We're on a back road something to see
Straight as a razor kicking the dust
Digging thru ditches and falling to rust

[Chorus]
Taking me far
Far as a rental car can go

[Verse 2]
Hey now girl at the end of the road
Down where the reaper is walking alone
Singing a death knell
Clapping along
At the end of the night
There's a road we'll be on

[Chorus]
Taking me far
Far as a rental car can go

[Verse 3]
Straight as a razor kicking the dust
Digging thru ditches and falling to rust

[Chorus]
Taking me far
Far as a rental car can go
