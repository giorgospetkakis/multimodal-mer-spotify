My sickness slips inside you
Drowning in my poison
Desperately I hide too from heaven
Now we'll be together
I can make you better
Siphon your pain in me, so I bleed

Feed your dreams to fishes
Lie about your wishes
Eat away at your time, seconds are mine
Sometimes it seems we're toxic
Wake me up and shock it
My low self-esteem can make me scream

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down
In my tears
Don't let me drown

(Solo)

It's only my psychosis
Feeling thorns of roses
Fill the void inside me so you see
Feed me tranquilizers
Calm the storm inside us
It's so perverse to say that I'm blind

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down
In my tears
(Tears)

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down (Break me)
Don't break me down (Break me)
Don't let me drown
