[Verse 1]
I've spent my last night
Strung up and pulled tight
Holding out, sleeping proud
An answer comes without a "please"
Do what you want

[Chorus]
Wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased?
Hanging on a cigarette
You need me
You burn me
You'll burn me

[Verse 2]
Hushed with a finger
Don't say you'll never when you might
Oh, just another time
This poison comes instruction free
Do what you want, but I'm drinking

[Chorus]
I wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased?
Hanging on a cigarette
You need me
You burn me
You'll burn me

[Bridge]
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh
Lie, lie better next time
Stay on my side tonight, oh

[Chorus]
I wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased?
Hanging on a cigarette
You need me
You burn me
You'll burn me

What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased?
Hanging on a cigarette
You need me
You burn me
You'll burn me
