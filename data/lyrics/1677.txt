[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking

[Verse 1]
Come in to my house
You're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house
Welcoming you into my house
Come in to my house
You're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house
Welcoming you into my house
I've invited loads to my house
Loads of people come to my house
They take stuff inside of my house
And smoke stuff outside of my house

[Chorus]
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking

[Verse 2]
Well, I've seen it before
Lots of people at my front door
Lots of people in my front door
Trying to get into my house
Well, I've seen it before
Lots of people in my front door
Lots of people at my front door
Trying to get into my house

[Chorus]
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking

[Verse 3]
We're merrymaking
All the stuff that you've being taking
All the stuff that I've being taking
All the stuff that we've being taking
We're merrymaking
All the stuff that we've being taking
All the stuff that I've being taking
All the stuff that you've being taking

[Chorus]
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place

[Bridge]
Merrymaking
Drug taking

[Chorus]
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Merrymaking
