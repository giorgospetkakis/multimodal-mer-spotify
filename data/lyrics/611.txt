How? How can it be
That a love, carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years, it's not so wrong
To be human after all

Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams, they can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you, baby
So right
I couldn't be without you, baby
Tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No-one could say
That you didn't feel a million things
In a perfect dream of life

Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love; it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years, they add to your confusion
But you need to hear the time that told the truth

There is something about you, baby
So right
I couldn't be without you, baby
Tonight

It's what makes the world go round
It's what makes the rivers flow, and
It's what makes the sparrows sing, and
It's what makes the flowers grow, and
It's what gives the babies breath, and
It's what gives the sun its shine, and
It's what makes the Phillies play
