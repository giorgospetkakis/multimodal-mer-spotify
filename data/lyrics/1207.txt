(that sounds so nice)

She did something for me one time
The gesture was sweet
Said "I'm doing this for you, darling
Don't leave it on the street!
With all those people!
Don't you know anything?"

Drinking steadily into the night
Doing a sailors' dance
Far below the clocktowers' height
I fell into her hands
She said, "I've got perfect Virgin's Feet
So come rest your head."

Recall the dying ember
Is that all you can remember?
We gotta have animal fat
The stone-age knife is blunt and bloody
I thought you were a quicker study still
We gotta have animal fat

My ancestors built society by conquering the sea (the sea, the sea)
Can't explain the source of sour voice coming up through me
The western people
They don't know anything

Recall the dying ember
Is that all you can remember?
We gotta have animal fat
The stone-age knife is blunt and bloody
I thought you were a quicker study still
We gotta have animal fat
Animal fat
Animal fat
