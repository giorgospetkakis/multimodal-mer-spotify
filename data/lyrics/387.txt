Goodbye suicide
Wipe the tears down from your eyes
Take my hand
Hold back pride - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Not for real but for this life
Au-revoir
Auf-wiedersein - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Never thought I'd tell a lie
See you later
Sianara- goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Beautiful to be so kind
Forever been
But never seen - goodbye suicide

If the ending fits the words
If you struggle to be heard
You can only try so hard
You can only try so fucking hard

So goodbye suicide
Innocence is not a crime
Hold back fear
Don't let it near - goodbye suicide
