[Verse 1]
Cradling stones, hold fire bright
As crickets call out to the moonlight
And as you lean in to steal a kiss
I'll never need more than this

[Verse 2]
We all share the pain of our histories
But the ache goes away, if you could see
This night under stars, well I call it peace
If you say, "I'll never need more than this"

[Bridge]
And the trees grow so thick
You can barely see through
And the forest bestows
All the simplest of truths

And you think you'll be happy
If granted one more wish
But the truth is, you'll never need more
You'll never need more, you'll never need more than this

[Verse 3]
Want so much in this life, there's so much to be
And we sail through our youth so impatiently
Until we see

[Pre-Chorus]
That the years move along
And soldiers and heroes come home
And they carry a song

[Chorus 1]
Don't live in forgotten times
May this always remind
You of the sea under the skies
Blue looking glass

[Chorus 2]
Let's make this our story
Let's live in the glory
Time, it fades away precious as a song
'Cause someday we'll be gone

[Verse 4]
Cradling stones hold fire bright
As we watch the glow of the morning light
Someday our bones here they will lie
And so we sing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
As the years move along
And soldiers and heroes come home
And they carry a song

[Chorus 2]
Let's make this our story
Let's live in the glory
Time it fades away precious as a song
'Cause someday we'll be gone
