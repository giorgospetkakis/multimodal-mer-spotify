[Refrain]
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right
I've gotta have my voice be heard
And bring meaning to this life

[Verse]
'Cause I've trusted for nothing
I've been led astray
I've been tried and tested
But I won't accept defeat
Now I've done things I regret
And it's time to reverse the roles
Now I just wanna make good on
All the promises I have made
(I will be)

[Chorus]
I
Will
Be
I will be heard
I
Will
Be
I will be heard
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
(I will be heard)
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
(I will be heard)

[Bridge]
(Through the worst, we prevail)
(So our voices will be heard)
(Through the worst, we prevail)
(So are voices will be heard)
Through the worst, we prevail
So our voices will be heard
Through the worst, we prevail
So are voices will be

[Refrain]
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right
I've got to have my voice be heard
And bring meaning to this life

[Verse]
'Cause I've trusted for nothing
I've been led astray
I've been tried and tested
But I won't accept defeat
Now I've done things I regret
And it's time to reverse the roles
Now I just wanna make good on
All the promises I have made
(I will be)

[Chorus]
I
Will
Be
I will be heard
I
Will
Be
I will be heard
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
(I will be heard)
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
(I will be heard)
I will be
