Bali Ha'i may call you
Any night and any day
In your heart you'll hear it call you
"Come away, come away"

Bali Ha'i will whisper
On the wind of the sea
"Here am I your special island"
"Come to me, come to me"

Your own special hopes
Your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams

If you try you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Your own special hopes
Your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams

If you try you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me
Bali Hai, Bali Hai, Bali Hai
