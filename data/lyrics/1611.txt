[Verse 1]
I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that'll rock, the boat will rock
I'll make a bomb of love and blow it up

[Chorus 1]
I did it, do you think I've gone too far?
I did it, guilty as charged
I did it, it was me right or wrong
I did it, yeah

[Chorus 2]
I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all

[Chorus 3]
And I opened up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice

[Verse 2]
I just did it for us all
It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done
The truth is that I don't really care
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time
You better lock me up, I'll do it again

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for the buzz

[Verse 3]
All you people are the skewers of our dreams
Like the cat that collared me
Oh, what I gotta say to you, you got love
Don't turn it down, turn it loud, let it build
We got a long way to go
But you, you got to start somewhere
Go door to door, spread the love you got
You got the love, you get what you want
Does it matter where you get it from?
I for one, don't turn my cheek for anyone
Unturn your cheek to give your love
Love to grow

[Chorus 1]
I did it, do you think I've gone too far?
I did it, guilty as charged
I did it, it was me right or wrong
I did it, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I did it, I told you, I told you I did
I did it, I'm guilty as charged
I did it, I told you, I told you I did
I did it, yeah

[Verse 4]
I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all

[Chorus 3]
