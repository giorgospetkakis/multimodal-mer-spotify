[Verse 1]
You make me agitated
With all the things you've hated
But you're uncomplicated
So why should it affect you
My loving was so untrue?
Yeaaahhhh...

[Chorus]
You do it to me sweetly
To my yeah-yeah,
You do it to me lovely
To my yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
You try to make me crazy
You make me agitated
But we're not suffocated
So why should it affect you
My loving was so untrue?

[Chorus]
You do it to me sweetly
To my yeah-yeah,
You do it to me lovely
To my yeah-yeah
