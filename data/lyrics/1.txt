What's that spell?
What's that spell?

Cheerleader: Baby

Earl had a baby
Baby was her name
He knew she was crazy
Tiny was the same
Down behind the shed
Slaughtering the hog
Slice it on the belly
Feed it to the dog

One, two, three, who should I kill?
Every motherfucker running up the hill
One, two, three, what should I do?
Get fucked up and fuck up you

Pussy liquor
Make ya sicker
Pussy liquor
Do it quicker

Baby: Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Goober: Yeah, I like to get fucked up too
Baby: Yeah, I bet you do
Baby: Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Goober: Yeah, I like to get fucked up too
Baby: Yeah, I bet you do

Earl had a baby
Otis was his name
White as a ghost, totally insane
Otis loves the girls
Young and clean
Drowning in a bucket of gasoline

One, two, three, who should I kill?
Every motherfucker running up the hill
One, two, three, what should I do?
Get fucked up and fuck up you

Pussy liquor
Make ya sicker
Pussy liquor
Do it quicker

Baby: Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Goober: Yeah, I like to get fucked up too
Baby: Yeah, I bet you do
Baby: Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Goober: Yeah, I like to get fucked up too
Baby: Yeah, I bet you do

Don't you know something
They won't tell
Time on my mind
Send them to a hell
Burnin' in the house
Spirits are alive
A tongue lashing mama
Help 'em to survive

One, two, three, who should I kill?
Every motherfucker running up the hill
One, two, three, what should I do?
Get fucked up and fuck up you

Pussy liquor
Make ya sicker
Pussy liquor
Do it quicker

Baby: Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Goober: Yeah, I like to get a blow job too
Baby: Yeah, I bet you do
