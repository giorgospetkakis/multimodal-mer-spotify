I don't want to think about you anymore
I don't want to think about you anymore
'Cause you've been on my mind
For such an endless stretch of time
And I don't want to think about you anymore

I've got to clear my head
Of everything you ever did
Of everything you ever said
I've got to clear my head
Of everything you ever did
Of everything you ever said

I don't want to put my trust in anyone
I don't want to put my trust in anyone
'Cause nothing that I knew
Turned out to be true
And I don't want to put my trust in anyone

I've got to clear my head
Of everything you ever did
Of everything you ever said
I've got to clear my head
Of everything you ever did
Of everything you ever said
