[Verse 1]
Man, I just saw something. I'm glad that you are here
I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear
'Cause now how could I forget what she left?
What happened in November is what  needed
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know?

[Chorus]
And now the sky's such a sweet blue
And you made this come true
And my heart feels so new
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)
Woah, woah
I'll never leave this you know

[Verse 2]
I'd turn it off for this
It looks like we got what we wished
It snowed in Texas but you missed (first time since '86)
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad?

[Chorus]
And now the sky's such a sweet blue
And you made this come true
And my heart feels so new
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)

[Bridge]
And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone
So broke, and cold
But now I'll show that I know

[Chorus]
That the sky's such a sweet blue
And you made this come true
And my heart feels so new
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue
(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)
Woah, woah
I'll never leave this you know
Woah, woah, woah
Woah-oh, woah, woah, woah
Woah-oh, woah, woah, woah
