[Chorus:]
Come on baby let's do the twist
Come on baby let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this
Ee-oh twist baby baby twist
Oooh-yeah just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist

[Verse 1:]
My daddy is sleepin' and mama ain't around
Yeah daddy just sleepin' and mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty
'Til we tear the house down
Come on and twist yeah baby twist
Oooh-yeah just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist

[Verse 2:]
Yeah you should see my little Sis
You should see my my little Sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist
Come on and twist yeah baby twist
Oooh-yeah just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist
Yeah rock on now
Yeah twist on now
Twist
