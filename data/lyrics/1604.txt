Come on! go!
Too dead for me... too dead for - too dead for me!
What do you say? (x2)
Too dead for me!
What do you say?
Too dead for - too dead for -
Too dead - what do you sell your soul for?
Too dead for - too dead for - 1, 2, 3, 4!
Too dead for me! too dead for -
It's just too dead for me!
Too dead for - too dead for -
What do you sell your damn soul for?
It's just too dead for me...
We won't keep quiet! we won't keep quiet!
We won't keep quiet! we won't keep quiet!
Never!
Fast like a blizzard - cold like stone
Luxury depression crushed your bones
This kinda think is too sad for me... go! go ! go! go!
You cry later - dope calculator
Nothing else but an empty prayer!
The safe side didn't work out? that's too bad for you...
What do you say?
We won't calm down! we won't calm down! we won
Too dead for - too dead for - (x3)
Too dead for me!
There's nothing going on for you?
Just look around you!
No! no! no! that's too dead for me!

Like a toy without belief -
Like a sead for a fascist society
You! you are too dead for me!

That's too dead for me... I don't wanna listen...
It would destroy the last dreams I've left for you...
Too dead for - too dead for - (x8)
Too dead for me! (x5)
I run around to see my soul smashed into pieces
Like a hole in my chest and it burns and it burns
It never stops!
They can't wait to waste my youth
Consumed like a corporation's entity
And then it stops! it just stops!

Come on!
Watch out! watch out!
Fools around me through the back door
Backbite! and we define what's hardcore!
And that's what I am! that's where I go!
I never understood what you sold your soul for...
Too dead for - too dead for - (x10)
Too dead for me! (x7)
What do you say?

Too dead for - too dead for - (x3)
What do you say?
Too dead for me...
What do you say?
