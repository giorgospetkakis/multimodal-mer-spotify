[Verse 1]
Put the houses in a row
On the streets we used to know
And all the things out in the yard
Beckoning there to and fro

[Chorus 1]
And if the money isn't right
Can I be yours tonight?
I've an easy heart

[Verse 2]
From the windows of your house
Reflects back on yourself
Then it gets you wondering
If it means anything

[Chorus 2]
And if the money isn't right
Can I be yours tonight?
I've had a pretty hard life
I've had a pretty hard life
For such an easy heart

[Verse 3]
You move away when you're young
They take away where you're from
And all the things out in the trees
Fall away into the breeze

[Chorus 2]
And if the money isn't right
Can I be yours tonight?
I've had a pretty hard life
I've had a pretty hard life
For such an easy heart

[Outro]
Easy heart
Easy heart
Easy heart
Easy heart
Easy heart
