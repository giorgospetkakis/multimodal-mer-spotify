[Verse 1]
As we build a brand new planet
Let's reconstruct and get it straight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Solace from the dark seduction
We are the new invention

[Verse 2]
We're the settlers of year zero
Let's reconstruct and take it back

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
The last freedom call

[Chorus]
Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb

Collect the word, add some gold
And give it back
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb

[Bridge]
From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice

[Verse 2]
As we're heading for the throne
Connect, evolution will begin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
The last freedom call

[Chorus]
Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
