Hurry, hurry
Come quickly
And leave all logic aside
Don't say a word
Just listen carefully to me...

"The world is ours if we could only let it be"

Every move we make
Will trigger another
And evrey small mistake
Will be a messenger...

"The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be."

Our lives are weaving like a thread
Within each other, faithfully
Sharing in our joys and miseries
And all that the world can give

Always, always

In the depths of our souls
Flickers of hope will show so clear
Like a pearl in the sea
A pearl in the sea

(the smiles on faces born in farmilliar places
We'll build ourselves islands upon the deepest oceans)

For the last time
This could be the last time
To pull it from the water
To wear around our necks

"The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be"

Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
