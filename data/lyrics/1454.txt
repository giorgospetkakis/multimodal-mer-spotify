Let's not forget, let's not forget what happened in the past
You were right, you were wrong, yeah, but everything was fast
And when we build this ship remember to make it last
Increase the time it takes to paint, and build the mast

Let's save this game for never
Oh, you know, this could be chess forever
I'll take your piece, and you'll take mine
We're stalemate, and we're just wasting time

Yeah the past, the route of the growing that happens now
So let's remember not to turn on straight to a row
And we can see through the haze of misty glaze
So now let's travel positively forward through the maze

Let's save this game for never
Oh, you know, this could be chess forever
I'll take your piece, and you'll take mine
We're stalemate, and we're just wasting time
We're just wasting time, we're just wasting time
We need a catalyst, we need a catalyst

And we'll swim, through the fields of hay
And we'll swim, through the fields of hay
And we'll swim, through the fields of hay
And we'll swim, through the fields of hay

You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
You're the catalyst that makes things faster
Amylase will dry up the plaster
