[Intro]
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And all the children sing
We hate love, we love hate

"We hate love, we love hate!"
"We hate love, we love hate!"

[Verse 1]
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

[Refrain]
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

[Verse 2]
Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim, you were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out

[Refrain]
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

[Chorus]
Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

[Verse 3]
I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
Better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell

I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself

[Refrain]
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

[Chorus]
Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

[Bridge]
America can not see anything
America can not see anything
America can not see anything
History was written by the winner

[Refrain]
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

[Chorus]
Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
