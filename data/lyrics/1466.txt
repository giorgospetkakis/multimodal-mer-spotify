Thinking back now
I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for?
For the weather or the battle of Agincourt

And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together
By the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder
I miss the rain

And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines
From behind it

Thanks all the same
But I cannot bring myself to answer your letter
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire

The polaroids that keep us together
Will surely fade away
Like the love that we sopke of forever
On St. Swithins Day...
