[Chorus]
Promises, promises
I'm feeling burned
You taught me a lesson
I didn't want to learn

[Verse]
Why did I come here?
Please tell me again
Why did you ask me?
Don't say you forget
I long for, I long for
I long for my home
I long for a land where
No man was ever known
With no neurosis
No psychosis
No psychoanalysis
And no sadness
I'll pick up the pieces
I'll carry on somehow
Tape the broken parts together
And limp this love around
Limp this love around[x8]

[Chorus]
