More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart
I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you that way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving maybe all you can give
But baby I can't live without it

Oh how I'd cry
Oh how I'd sigh
If you grew tired and said goodbye

More than I'd show
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving mayba all you can give
But baby I can't live without it

Oh how I'd cry
Oh how I'd sigh
If you grew tired and said goodbye

More than I'd show
More than you'll ever know
I love my darling
More than you will ever know
