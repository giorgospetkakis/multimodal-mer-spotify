Shut up
I'm thinking
Shut up
I'm thinking
Shut up
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
So shut up

If I hold you too tight
Just say let go
I know this touch can leave you hurting
When my words clatter about your head
Don't go to bed
Just say "shut up"

'Cause in my sleep I still clench my teeth
I'm at my strongest only when I'm weak
I can give you those bruises just by talking to you
You know I can laugh `til you're almost through
Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
I'm thinking, oh

Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
Shut up, yeah
I'm thinking, oh
