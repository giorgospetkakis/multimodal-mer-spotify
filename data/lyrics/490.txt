Oh, Cecille my love
How can it be
That one so small
Should carry me
When I am weak?

Oh, Cecille my love
The river holds the gun
I used to kill the one
Who held us apart
For so long

Your father's house
I have burned down
I saved the letters you wrote
But could not send
I saved the one you wrote me
Of your death

Thereâ€™s a place
On the hill
Where you and I shall dwell
It's by the sea
The grave I made
So we can rest in peace

Oh, Cecille my love
The river has washed up
The only way I see you soon
Father, forgive me for what I do
