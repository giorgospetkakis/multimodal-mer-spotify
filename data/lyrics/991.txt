[Verse 1]
Saturday, what a day, what a silly little day
Time to kill, take a pill as I sit and contemplate
How I'd like to be around all the people in the town with their fancy cars and things
But I, I've got time

[Chorus]
Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you if you drag your heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays

[Verse 2]
In the haste, in the grace, I've been up to my waist
It isn't real what you feel when you find love in a chase
I've been waiting for the day when someone takes me away and I never get replaced
But I, I've got time

[Chorus]
Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you if you drag your heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays
These Saturdays now
(ooh-ooh-oh-da-dun)

[Verse 3]
As I sink one more drink I am running out of ink
Feeling void paranoid about every little thing
And I wonder if I try to get up and say goodbye if I'll have the strength to leave
Cause I, I don't have much time anymore

[Chorus]
Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you if you drag your heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays
These Saturdays, now
These Saturdays now, oh baby
