[Intro]
Our love is rock steady

[Verse 1]
Love is like a punishment
Homegirl here to represent
So innocently you seem to come my way
While Tinkerbell and Cupid play
They sit there and they laugh
I sit here and I can’t believe my eyes
You found me at last
But we’re too human to see the way we’ll agonize

[Chorus]
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

[Verse 2]
Steady now stop rocking it
It’s a delicate environment
Retired but sleeping is our shanty love
Be careful now, don’t wake it up

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s never gonna last
It’s never gonna make it back alive
So now can we relax?
I really hope that we will actually survive

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Our love is so rock steady
