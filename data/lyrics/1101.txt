I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely

I think of you
Wherever you may go
I know that you are only one dream away

So don't give up
Baby, don't give in
If we try, we can begin again
I know what we've been through
But I still think of you

I think of you
Whenever I get down
Whenever I get dreary

I think of you
When you're not around
I wonder if you hear me
Call out your name

So don't give up
Baby, don't give in
If we try, we can begin again
I know what we've been through
But I still think of you

I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely

I think of you
Whenever I get down
Whenever I get weary

I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely

I think of you...
