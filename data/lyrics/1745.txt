I am raising a flag
I am just too tired now to fight
It's white and it's waving
Can't we save this for another night
I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright

Baby, put your arms down
They're machines that can't be fixed no more
Cause when the alarm sounds
I'll be right here waiting at your door
We'll sit up on the bed for a while
Together we are both alone, but we don't mind
We'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright

But the dawn is trouble
When I close my eyes, you never go away
I've tried everything, still you won't change
Is it better if you goâ€¦

But the ending doesn't matter
One hundred days and then the suffering stops
Running faster through this
Hope to save your heart before it drops
And you can never say I didn't try
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us alright

It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
