[Verse 1]
Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
As a death from old age becomes nearer
Why can't the livestock be free
When trading soldiers for steak

[Pre-Chorus]
Learn to evolve with the new transition
To act upon a hypocritical vision
Discard the old and in with the new
Discard the old and in with the fashion

[Chorus]
Learn to evolve with the new transition
To act upon a hypocritical vision
Learn to evolve, learn to
Learn to evolve

[Verse 2]
Who is the bad guy
For iron, require mince
These are the facts
So eat what you murder
This is animal liberation
Eight billion killed for human pleasure

[Verse 3]
Bring on the ape farm
Demolish the monkeys
Drink up, drink up
Look down on junkies
A new hypocritical look and ambition
The time has come
To make the decision, you
Drink up, drink up, look down
I'll hold it back, I'll hold it back

[Refrain Chorus]
Discard the old, in with the fashion

[Refrain Verse 1]
Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
