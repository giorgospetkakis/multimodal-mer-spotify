Eight weeks in the city
And you've never looked so pale
They say the pure of heart don't stand a chance
And you'd better learn to swim
'Cos there will be rainy days

I'm blinded the brake lights
Well there's nothing moving here
And all your burning questions, they just get answered with another one
And there's no help at all

So question me no questions
It's a pointless enterprise
You ask and i'll only tell you what i think you want to hear
Oh mind the whitest lies

'Cos the truth
Well it's for students for philosophy
And faith is for losers like us
And secrets are for people who intend to get away with being in the wrong
So don't you breath a word

But save your breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath
For the talking all night, oh..
Save you breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath

Save your breath

Will you listen to their bleeding hearts?
Pretend to show concern
And so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings
Oh what have we become?

Will you hop a train to anywhere?
It sure ain't no place like home
Where there are no strangers
Only people you don't wanna know

But before the crying out loud..

Just save your breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath
For the talking all night, oh
Save your breath
For the laughing aloud, oh
Save your breath

Save your breath

So meet me by the station
And bring a change of heart
And smile away the old country as we watch it dissappear
And pull these years apart

And scatter from the window
To settle on the fields
And tell yourself a hundred times that forever starts today
And think how good it feels

To save your breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath
For the talking all night, oh
Save your breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath

Save your breath

To save your breath
For the laughing aloud, again
Save your breath
For the talking all night, oh
Save your breath
For the laughing aloud, oh
Save your breath

Save, oh...

Save your breath
(Don't waste your breath on treading water anymore)

Save your breath
(There must be something you consider to be worth fighing for)

Save your breath
(Waste your breath on running circles, round and round and round)

Save your breath
(And talking about it when it cannot get you down)

Save your breath
(Nobody want's that much we just want more)

Save your breath
(Don't waste your breath on treading water anymore)

Save your breath
(Don't waste your breath on running circles, round and round and round and round)

Save your breath

Save your breath
