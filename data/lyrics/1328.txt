There's something crawling
There's something crawling in the dark
I don't see it, but I know it's after me

There's something lurking
Oh, there's something lurking in the dark
I don't see it, but I know it's here for me

I don't feel it
I'm not afraid of it
'Cause I'm as evil as can get
Nothing's ever scared me yet

Hey hey hey
Creepy crawler
What's wrong with you now
You seem a little smaller

Hey hey hey
Creepy crawler
Crawl back from where you came
You're not worth a dollar

There's something lurking
Oh, there's something lurking in the dark
I don't see it, but I know it's here for me

There's something crawling
There's something crawling in the dark
I don't see it, but I know it's after me

'Cause I'm as evil as can get
Nothing's ever scared me yet
