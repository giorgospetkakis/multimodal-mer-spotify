[Verse 1]
Last week
Kyle quit the band
Now we're back together, uh
Misunderstanding
Didn't understand
It doesn't matter
Now we're back together again
La-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Jack Black & (Kyle Gass)]
Couldn't split up Kato and Nash
(That's true)
Couldn't split up Tango and Cash
That's also true

[Verse 3]
This is our song of exultant joy, because
We only came to kick some ass
Rock the fucking house
And kick some ass
What we gonna do with all the cash?
Smoke hash
And then we thrash
We'll throw a big ol' bash y'all
And everyone is invited to the bash
And everyone, you're all invited to the bash

[Outro]
Come on Kyle
One time, come on
