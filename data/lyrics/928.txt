I met you through a common friend
In the attic of my parents' house
And though I didn't know it then
I soon was finding out

You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet and hold the earth in place
Each time a faucet opens, words are spoken, the water runs away
And I hear your name
No, nothing has changed

There was this book I read and loved
The story of a ship
Who sailed around the world and found
That nothing else exists

Beyond his own two sails and wooden shell and what is held within
All else is sure to pass, we clutch and grasp and debate what's truly permanent
But when the wind starts to shift
Well, there's no argument

Now, I sing and drink and sleep on floors and try hard not to be annoyed
By all these people worrying about me
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive, you occasionally cross my mind
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
Well are you?

Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet and hold the earth in place
Each time a curtain opens sunlight pours in, a lifetime melts away
And we share a name
On some picturesque grave
