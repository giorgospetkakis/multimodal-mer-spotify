[Verse 1]
It’s buried deep within the past and I hope it doesn’t last
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
I try to give it all away, but it’s never going to fade
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)
I know you feel it’s all the same, but I promise that I’ll change
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
You know I’m trying to believe that you’re never going to leave
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)

There’s nothing left, the fear is gone

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

[Verse 2]
I know I’m not the perfect one and this has pain just begun
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
You bring me to a better path, and it’s everything I lack
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)

There’s nothing left, the fear is gone
There’s nothing left, the fear is gone

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

If you fade out without me will you know all about me?
If you fade out without me will you know all?

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
