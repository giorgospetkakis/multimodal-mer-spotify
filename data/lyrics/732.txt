How I will rise up from the waters where I've drowned
You will know me
You will see
Your face will light up from the glory that it's found
I am listening
You are hearing me
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see
You'll find out I am nothing I might seem
It's not opened so easily
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see
Don't go
Make your mind up
I've been down far as can be
Up until then my voice, it was caught up
Up until then, I never could see
