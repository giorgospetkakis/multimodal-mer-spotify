Start spreadin' the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up
In a city that never sleeps
And find I'm A number 1
Top of the list
King of the hill
A number 1

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York

And if I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York!

New York!
