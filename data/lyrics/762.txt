[Verse 1]
S-s-saying I'm looking now at pictures of us;
I remember thinking, "Oh, this will never leave us."
Oh, the songs that spoke for me
When I couldn't speak
Shame the band's broke up I just hope we'll remember these

[Chorus]
Hold it up, hold it tight
Moments live or moments die
Hold it up, hold it strong
Stay right here where you belong
Hold it up, hold it tight
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché
But I just plan to live the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
S-s-saying I want to know these pictures of us
I don't want to say goodnight to records I love
I was thinking of not growing old, forgetting and forgot
I don't want to forget this, and I don't want to be forgot

[Chorus]
Hold it up, hold it tight
Moments live or moments die
Hold it up, hold it strong
Stay right here where you belong
Hold it up, hold it tight
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché
But I just plan to live the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Hold it up, hold it tight
Moments live or moments die
Hold it up, hold it strong
Stay right here where you belong
Hold it up, hold it tight
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché
But I just plan to live the rest of my life
