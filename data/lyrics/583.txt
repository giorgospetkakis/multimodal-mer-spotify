Smooth road, clear day
Why am I the only onetraveling this way
How strange the road to love should be so easy
Can there be a detour ahead

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart gullable clown
You fool you're heading in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead

The farther you travel
The harder to unravel
The web he spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Can't you see the dangerous signs
Sot shoulders surround you

Smooth road clear night
Oh lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm heading back away from all this trouble
Smooth road, smooth road
No detour ahead
