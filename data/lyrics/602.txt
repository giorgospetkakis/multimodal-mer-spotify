She watched the sky as it bathes into black
Watched with the lovers that never came back
The princes and kings, all the beautiful things
And more

She won't wait, she'll never look back
Through the morgue where the mirrors have crashed
She slides through a dream with all her beautiful schemes
And more

She's got a reason to roam with the stars
Watch her go as she sings
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara

Love is gold, time is a thief
She's the river that runs to the sea
With her arms open wide, a sorrowful smile
And more

Still she wonders soaked to the bone
The road she's on, well, it won't lead her home
To the place she cried for the stranger inside
And more

She's got a reason to roam with the stars
Watch her go as she sings
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara

She watched the sky as it bathes into black
Watched with the lovers that never came back
The princes and kings, all the beautiful things
And more

She's got a reason to roam with the stars
Watch her go as she sings
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara
