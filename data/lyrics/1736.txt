When the sun was down
I opened my eyes
And I looked around
All the stars were bound
To fall from the sky
I would make no sound
Take good care
Take good care
I can hold you
And console you
I can show you another rainbow
Take good care - I can make you one
I can hold you
Like I told you
I can fold you another rainbow
Take good care - I can make you one
Where's that distant light ?
There used to be one
Once we used to lie
Under the sun
All the things that I
Would treasure have gone
Now I'm satisfied
I can hold you
And console you
I can show you another rainbow
Take good care - I can make you one
I can hold you
Like I told you
I can fold you another rainbow
Take good care - I can make you one
