[Verse 1]
We are the animals
Who have lost our hair
Retained some of our teeth
And gained a choice
We'll chase food, money and sex
Until satisfied
And when its time to rest
Ask "whats next?"

[Refrain]
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals

[Chorus]
Well its hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
Biologists and chemists reducing our souls
To four letters
And when we think about it
We're like a masterpiece
Whose glimpsed the artist

[Verse 2]
We are the machines
Carrying our various genes
Then discarded
When the job is done
We are the disciples
Who have lost our way
Kicked from our pedestal when Darwin burnt the book

[Refrain]
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals

[Chorus]
Well its hard enough to retain control
When our instincts are egging us on
Biologists and chemists reducing our souls
To four letters
Will genes replace Genesis?
We're like a masterpiece
Whose glimpsed the artist

[Bridge]
We like to think we're at a special place
The stars revolve around the human race
But we're just mammals, just primates
Like chimps or gorillas
We see the hair on our face
And look at another primate
You and I, we relate

[Outro]
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
