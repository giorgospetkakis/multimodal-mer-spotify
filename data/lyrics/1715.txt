[Verse 1]
The shades gone up
Mothers staring down
She don't know where he's been
Or how long he's been out

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, I'm tired of waiting up while you're out with your friends"
He said, "Mom, I'm trying and I'm living my life the best way that I can"

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down

[Verse 2]
The day has come
The sun is moving on
She don't know where he'll go
Or when he's coming home

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Son, take care, don't let your dreams get too far out of sight"
He said, "I love you. Now, don't worry about me, you know I'll be fine"

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down
No
I'm not trying to be somebody else
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you
I won't ever let you

[Bridge]
What they say
What they know
What they think won't ever bring me down
This life is mine
And I am my own

[Interlude]
I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I lead
Don't you know me?

[Chorus]
I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down

[Outro]
I'm not trying to be somebody else
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down
I won't be nobody else
This life is mine and I am my own
