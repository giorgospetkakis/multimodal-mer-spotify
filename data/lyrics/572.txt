Did I really meet her
Or was it just a sweet dream
Lingers in the morning
Like a melody
Over and over all through the day
I can't stop thinking about how I'm feeling this way

She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me
The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

We found each other, staring at the waves
Started talkin', I couldn't break away
And made plans to meet tonight
Down by the pier, when midnight strikes I'm going to hold that dream near

She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me
The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

To my surprise oh
She took my heart with one look in her eye
To a place that feels like home

She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me
The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me
The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

These eyes have seem the most beautiful dream
Oh, oh
