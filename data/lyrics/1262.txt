Darling, hold on to my love
Hold on to my touch
A little bit more
For all affection
That I've grudged you
For all loads I let you carry
I owe you

Ashamed to be someone
Who took you for granted
Who took and demanded
The whole of you

So darling, hold on to my love
Hold on to my touch
A little bit more

'Cause I'd be broken
I'd be broken
I'd be broken, without you

All the visions
Would mean nothing
I need your touching
Getting to my soul

So darling, hold on to my love
Hold on to my touch
A little bit more

'Cause I'd be broken
I'd be broken
I'd be broken, without you

From now on, I'll always share my loving mind
I'll put my heart into your soul
I'll be tender, I'll defend for you
I'll give it all, that belongs to you

'Cause I'd be broken
I'd be broken
I'd be broken, without you

'Cause I'd be broken
I'd be broken
I'd be broken, without you
