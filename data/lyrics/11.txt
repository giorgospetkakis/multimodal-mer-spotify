[Verse 1]
If I am silent, then I am not real
If I speak up, then no one will hear
If I wear a mask, there's somewhere to hide

[Chorus 1]
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

[Verse 2]
If I raise my voice, will someone get hurt?
And if I can't feel, then I won't get touched
If no truths are spoken, then no lies can hide

[Chorus 2]
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins
Silence is golden
Nobody gets in
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

[Bridge]
Did you hear me speak?
Do you understand?
Did you hear my voice?
Will you hold my hand?
Do you understand me?

[Outro]
Won't someone listen?
Nobody gets in
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Something was stolen
Safe in my own skin
Safe in my own skin
Won't someone listen?
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
Something was stolen
I have been broken
I have been broken
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
