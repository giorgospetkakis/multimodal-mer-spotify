[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
Blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them, make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

[Verse 2]
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them, make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

[Verse 3]
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you, smells so sweet

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

[Verse 4]
My soul is longing before, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sleep myself
My face is long forgotten, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, your spirits dance
Like a double dozen before you, no romance

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am
