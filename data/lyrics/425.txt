I woke up this morning and knew
That the world would test me, come unglued
Is it me or do you feel my pain
This world makes my blood boil again

You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
You make it look easy
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me

I try everything to please you
Gone out of my way like a fool
What makes me break down like a bitch
It's so hard to grow out of this ditch

You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
You make it look easy
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
You make it look easy
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
Control and deceive me
You rip the heart out of me, rip the heart out of me
