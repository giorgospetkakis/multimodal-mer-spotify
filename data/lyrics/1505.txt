I was on your porch
The smoke sank into my skin
So I came inside to be with you

We talked all night
About everything you could imagine
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone

And as our eyes start to close
I turn to you and I let you know
That I love you

Well my dad was sick
My mom, she cared for him
Her loving nursed him back to life

And me, I ran
I couldn't even look at him
For fear I'd have to say goodbye

And as I start to leave
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
"What's left to lose?
You've done enough
And if you fail, well then you fail, but not to us

'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone"

So now here I sit
In a hotel off of Sunset
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar

And that's the way its been
Ever since we were kids, but now
Now, we've got something to prove

And I, I can see their eyes
But tell me something, can they see mine?
'Cause what's left to lose?
I've done enough
And if I fail, then I fail, but I gave it a shot

'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone

(Even if it's alone)

Even if it's alone

I was on your porch last night
The smoke, it sank into my skin
