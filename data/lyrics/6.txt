Maybe I'm the joker
Maybe I'm the fool in your eyes
Maybe I'm the weak one
Maybe I'm a lie in disguise
Maybe I'm angry
'Cause I'm the one who's always wrong
But maybe I'm not the one who's so strong

Did you think about it?
Did you pull it in and pour it out?
Could you live without me?
Did you ever really have a doubt?
But do you understand it, baby?
When you say, “It's over”, it's done
Maybe I'm not the one

So if you're gonna leave
Yeah, you better get goin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time
On what you did and what you didn't do
If you’re gonna leave
Yeah, you better start runnin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time
On what might've been

We can stand on reason
We can fight about all the things
This isn't forever
This is more than a wedding ring
But do you understand it, baby?
When you say, “It's over”, it's done
Maybe I'm not the one

So if you're gonna leave
Yeah, you better get goin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time
On what I did and what I didn't do
If you're gonna leave
Yeah, you better start runnin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

O-oh, did it happen again?
With the things that you wanted
For being a friend
How did it happen again?
Just look onward, baby
‘Cause someday you might need a friend
(Friend)

So if you're gonna leave
Yeah, you better get goin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time
On what we did and what we didn't do
If you’re gonna leave
Yeah, you better start runnin'
‘Cause I ain't wastin' no more time

No, I ain't wastin' no more time
On what might've been
