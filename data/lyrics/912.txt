[Verse 1]
Tainted, has our love gone cold?
In a place that's bitter and broken
We tasted of a world unknown
Surely there must be something better, something forever

[Chorus]
Hello, from the world below
While I'm watching the sun burning
As the road is slowly turning
When I know that in letting go
While I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

[Verse 2]
Walking past the city lights
Silence can be so disturbing
You'll find me standing in the night
The stars never seem so unending, so unending

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But we painted almost everything without
There remains our shadows and the stones
Tell me where did we go wrong?
Can we just move on?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, hello to the world below
While I'm watching the world spinning
This night seems so unending
Well, I'll follow to a place I know
That's only the beginning
Start over after ending
