Few creatures of the night
Have captured our imagination, like vampires
What explains our enduring fascination with vampires?

What is it about the vampire myth that explains our interest?
Is it the overtones of sexual lust, power, control
Or is it a fascination with the immortality of the undead?

And what dark and hidden parts of our psyche are aroused
And captivated by the legends of the undead
By the legends of the undead, by the legends of the undead

The mysteries of the undead will continue to fascinate the living
The mysteries of the undead will continue to
Will continue to fascinate the living, vampires

Few creatures of the night
Have captured our imagination, like vampires
What explains our enduring fascination with vampires

And what dark and hidden parts of our psyche are aroused
And captivated by the legends of the undead
By the legends of the undead
