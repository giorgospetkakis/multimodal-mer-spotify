Good people all, this Christmas-time
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending His beloved Son
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day:
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
"Arise and go," the angels said
"To Bethlehem, be not afraid;
For there you'll find, this happy morn
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born."

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the Babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Saviour Christ behold
Within a manger He was laid
And by his side the Virgin Maid
As long foretold upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born
