[Verse 1]
Two months of fun
Two years of pain
Add it up
And get a life of rain
Need to scream
But too ashamed
I'm gonna rain, I'm gonna rain
You wanna go, you wanna stay
You wanna
You really blew my world
I wanna live and there's only one way

[Chorus]
I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
I don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you up
Won't you save me?

[Verse 2]
Two months of sun
A life of rain
Add it up
I'm on my own again
Need to scream
I'm so filled with rage
Gonna rain, gonna rain
You wanna go, you wanna stay
You wanna
You really screwed my world
I gotta live but you stand in the way
I'm pullin out now, uh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
Don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you up

[Bridge]
Oh, oh oh
Oh oh baby, do you think that I was strong?
Oh oh baby, can't you see that you were wrong?
Oh oh honey, do you think that I was strong?
Ah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
I don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you, give you, give you
You got me really going out of my mind

[Outro]
Oh oh baby, do you think that I was strong?
Oh oh honey, can't you see that you were wrong?
Oh oh baby, do you think that I was strong?
Ahh
Oh oh baby, do you think that I was strong?
Oh oh honey, can't you see that you were wrong?
Oh oh baby, can't you see that's all we lost?
