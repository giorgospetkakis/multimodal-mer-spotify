[Verse 1]
It's only now when words are said
That break my heart in two
I wonder how you can endure
All I've said, all I say to you

[Verse 2]
How strong, how brave, how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave
I know it tears your heart in two
All I've said, all I say to you

[Bridge]
After all the words are said
After all the dreams we made
Every one a precious one
Every one a summer sun

[Verse 3]
A moment lost, forever gone
Can never be again
So know how much it means to me
All you said, all you gave
All your love to me
