Wish I could remember why it mattered to me
It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me anymore
Now that you're feeling fine
I'll admit that - though I know it's coming down
And see it shattering me - it doesn't matter to me
And I'm not sadder for seeing it come
I'm not going to run
I will just come when I am called

You want to cut me off
Because I took too much
But don't leave me alone
Take off your scarves, your winter coat
The night's too cold

When we met I should have said
You're like a sister to me
How all that kiss her just seem
Like puny suitors I can see through
How none will do, not for you
It might as well just be us two
And when I pulled you by the jacket
From the clattering street
You started flattering me
You started saying I was so strong
String me along, but I can't become all that I'm called

And I can't claim to know
What makes love die or grow
But I can still take control
And so refuse to just go home
Back down the hall

And as I crawl
As finally all the false confetti blooms up in this attic room
I'm going make my stand
I want to see both of your hands put down the phone
I won't let you go
Although the moment stole my self-control
From us all and now it can only end with a fall
