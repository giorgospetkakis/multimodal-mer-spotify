[Intro]
La la la la laaa
La la la la laaa
La la la la laaa
La la la la laaa

[Verse 1]
Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on keeping on

Out to sea
Is the only place I honestly
Can get myself some piece of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly

[Chorus]
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

[Chorus]
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

[Chorus]
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

[Bridge]
Guess I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time

[Outro]
(As Churchill said
It's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes
What's it going to do, vanish?
Is it not going to be there when I get back?)
