Resignated across the rubicon awaiting salvation in the void
Standing at the threshold of another paindriving reign
A typical winter storm dissolved in a colorless rainbow
A monument for the ruptured two seasons away from summer
Caressing the bleakness a smile from the living dead
In praise of sanity the courage to leave it all behind
The Swan's song the rejection of the light once more
