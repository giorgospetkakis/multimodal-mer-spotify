Flew off early in the haze of dawn
In a metal dragon lost in time
Skimming waves of an underground sea
In some kind of dreamworld fantasy

Sun a hot circle on a canopy
'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land
Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands

Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky
Reaching twisted claws on every side
No place to run, no place to hide
No turning back on a suicide ride

Toy city streets crawling through my sights
Sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal
This dream won't ever, ever end
And time seems like it'll never begin

30 seconds and a one way ride
30 seconds and no place to hide
30 seconds and a one way ride
30 seconds and no place to hide
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
