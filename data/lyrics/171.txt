[Verse 1]
I wanna do this thing
I don't want no drama mama
It's love I bring
Oh, wait a minute
You're out of sight
Girl I wanna give it to you
Let's make it right

[Chorus]
You
You are my life and my passion
That never goes out of fashion
I want to know
Will you marry me

[Verse 2]
Hey baby
Will you wear my ring
You're a queen and I've been waiting
To be a king
Baby, baby
Let's keep it tight
If you want to get right to it
Could be tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come on baby
Keep it tight
I know it's right
I wanna have you always in my life
Hit it

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
No I like that
Do that one more time

[Chorus][x3]
