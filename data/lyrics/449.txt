Hey, dude-it'z true not sad
Take a thrash song and make it better
Remembah! That metal iz in your heart
Then you can start to be a fretter

Hey, dude-don't be fuckin' 'fraid
You were made to go be a shredder
The minute you let us under your skin
Then you'll begin to be a fretter

So crank your amp and deal the pain
Hey, dude-you're fuckin' insane!
The riverz run red with blood of poseurs
And don't you know that he'z the fool
Who playz it cool
But needz for hiz beer to be much colder

Hey, dude-nevah turn it down!
You must pound her, I mean Kip Winger
New wave of British heavy metal iz in your heart
And you can start with Diamond Headerz

So let it out! Let it in!
Hey, dude, begin
Don't wait for the Eye of the Beholder
You'll never know when bellz toll for you
Hey, dude, you'll do
Just sling that flying-V 'cross your shoulder

Hey, dude-it'z true not sad
Take a thrash song and make it better
Admit it! Metallica'z under your skin!
So now begin to be a shredder
