[Verse 1]
Well, I swear your perfume, baby
Is made out of turnip greens
Every time I kiss you, girl
It tastes like pork and beans
Even though you're wearin' those
Uptown high heels
I can tell from your giant step
You been walkin' through the cotton fields

[Refrain]
Oh
You're so
Down home
Girl

[Verse 2]
Every time you monkey, child
Takes my breath away
Well every time you move like that, girl
I got to get down and pray
Girl, you know that dress you're wearin'
Is made out of fiberglass
Every time you move like that, girl
I got to go to Sunday Mass

[Refrain]
Oh
You're so
Down home
Girl

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna take you to the muddy river
And push you in
So I can watch the water roll
On down your velvet skin
I'm gonna take you down to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
So I can watch you do the second line
With an umbrella in your hand

[Refrain]
Oh
You're so
Down home
Girl
