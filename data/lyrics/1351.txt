[Verse 1]
Countless times I trusted you
I let you back in
Knowing, yearning
I should have run, but I stayed

[Chorus]
Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken for you

[Verse 2]
Today I introduced myself
To my own feelings
In silent agony, after all these years
They spoke to me after all these years

[Chorus]
Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken for you
