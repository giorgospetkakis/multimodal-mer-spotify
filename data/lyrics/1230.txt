Miss Mary Mac, Mac, Mac
All dressed in black, black, black
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons
All down her back, back, back
She asked her mom, mom, mom
For 15 cents, cents, cents
To see the elephants, elephants, elephants
They jumped the fence, fence, fence
They jumped so high, high, high
They reached the sky, sky, sky
And never came back, back, back
Till the 4th of July, lie, LIAR!

I'm sorry that I'm getting chubby
And I cannot always be happy for you
And I am not some lame sorority queen
Taking you home to meet my daddy

You collect your trust funds baby
And I'll be a whore
And we'll pretend we're just the same but
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know that I
I am hiding
The you I show to you is just a lie

You take what you want
You get what you take
You take what you want
You get what you take
But I've got something, man
That your fucking money cannot buy

You never know, never know, never know what
You never know, never know, never know what
You wanna take but you can't have it
You don't know what it's like to be alive

I could scream the truth if I wanted
Right through your lies
But your baseball bat wounds, razormouth
Carve your initials bloody in my thighs
