Don't you know sometimes
These things they don't work out?
Best to walk away
Before your love runs out
Don't you feel sometimes
You don't know who you are
Giving all you got
But you're all just taking off

I'm love..sick
I'm lovesick
I'm love..sick
I'm lovesick

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms
Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms

Don't you feel sometimes
You might need this just too much
When everybody else
Thinks you're out of touch?
Don't you think it's about time
You turn the page and move on?
And learn to shake it up
Before your love runs out

I'm love..sick
I'm lovesick
I'm love..sick
I'm lovesick

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms
Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms

(I'm love..sick
I'm love..sick)

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms
Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms

Love..sick
