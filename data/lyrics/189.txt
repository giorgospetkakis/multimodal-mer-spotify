[Verse 1]
They say 'Freak'
When you're singled out
The red
Well, it filters through

[Chorus]
So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

[Bridge]
Seeing red again
Seeing red again

[Verse 2]
This change
He won't contain
Slip away
To clear your mind

[Verse 3]
When asked
Who made it show
The truth
He gives in to most

[Chorus]
So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus x2]
So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

[Bridge 2)
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red!

[Outro]
They say 'Freak'
When you're singled out
The red
It filters through
