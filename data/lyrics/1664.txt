[Dialogue: Wild Things & Max]
You are now the king
And you will be a truly great king
Oh, it looks good on him, look-
He looks great, hey, king!
You look perfect
He looks perfect
Fresh king!
Hey, king what's your first order of business?
Let the wild rumpus start!
Perfect answer!

[Intro: Karen O and the Kids]
One we say, off we go
Two we say, off we go

[Verse: Karen O and the Kids]
To the door, in the floor
It's the dawn of the day
You can stop
And just say that it's mine
I know we don't need it
All in line we go
We don't need it
All in line you go, go, go, go
Wild
