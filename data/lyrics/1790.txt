[Verse 1]
Pregnant mothers in Mexico
Give birth to still-born monster babies
Hideous deformed two-headed monsters
Vivisected for your magazine essay

[Chorus]
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon to the violent world with me
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon to the violent world with me

[Verse 2]
Nazi demons, Nazi youth
Wolverines in dark brown suits
They shove you in an oven and you start to cook
Blame it all on Nazi youth

[Chorus]
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon to the violent world with me
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon to the violent world with me

[Verse 3]
Any opportunity comes
Can't afford to rot, so you move on
Any opportunity comes
Can't afford the Nazi movement

[Bridge]
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon

[Outro]
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
