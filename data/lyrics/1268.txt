Silence
The world is still sleeping
Nobody but me and the candlelight
I see the shadow of the flame
My breathing makes it play
On your face my love on the picture
On the wallâ€¦

First sunray
The world is creeping in
Another lonely day with it standing on my way
The twinkle in your eye
Appears to me in light
Would you take my hand
And lead me through without a fight

Another worthless day
Nowhere to go nowhere to feel at home
Another lonely day
I need your love can't make it on my own

The paperboy comes by
With news that makes me cry
