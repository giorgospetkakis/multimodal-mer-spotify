[Verse 1]
How I remember sleepless nights
When we would read by candlelight
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow

[Verse 2]
A million feathers falling down
A million stars that touch the ground
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow

[Chorus]
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around

[Verse 3]
The silence of a winter's night
Brings memories I hold inside
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make sound
In the darkness all around

[Verse 5]
I close my window to the night
I leave the sky her tears of white
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow

[Outro]
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow
