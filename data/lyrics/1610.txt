Every night that I spend alone
You don't know, you don't know me at all
And in my life of a girl, of the troubles and love
I'm a troubled, troubled heart

Thought I'd sing with the boats
Trouble all away
That they'd swim back to me today
My troubles are never going to leave me alone

A prayer told me
The rosary that I wear on my neck
Stare out to sea
Ghosts overhead, bird in a tree
I feel numb and cold, rosary

Numb cold and free, rosary
Rosary
