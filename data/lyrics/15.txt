[Verse 1]
Man tend a next shot of tequila
The vibes tonight yeah, so sweet yah
I man spot this sweet senorita
We a bounce to the bass and di tweeter
She look, muy bonita
The way she move remind me of Selena

[Bridge]:
She rock so, she dip so
She wanna dance to reggae and calypso
Look how the dress hug up pon her hips so
Look how she move fast and a do it slow
Muy bonita
Mamacita

[Hook]:
Gal whine let me come behind yuh
Eh! Me make she feel alright
Woulda dance all night if yuh want to
Eh! 'Till a mornin light
Love how you feel in front a me so
Gal, let me hold you tight

[Verse 2]
Look deh, a pure death in the arena
Number one gal, prima ballerina
Little girl, how u fi come in here
She nuh drink, only smoke sensimilla
She look, muy bonita
You nuh see it, that a my Mona Lisa
