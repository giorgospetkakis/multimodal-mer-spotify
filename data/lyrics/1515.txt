If I could hold you
You know I would
If the whole world would
Just stop turning and be real still

I said I?d meet you after midnight
I know I never did return
A lot of promises were broken
I never kept to my word

Crawling on my knees for you, for you
It feels like some Saturday cartoon, oh yeah
If I could tell ya, yeah, the way that I feel
Would you believe enough in magic
And carnival wheels?

Life is never say you?re sorry
Love is never make mistakes
Life is telling me the answer
If I can?t believe the rain

I meant to tell you I?m sorry
For all the hurt and senseless pain
I need to tell you I?m sorry
For all the love we never got to make

Calling me back
To the room on the hill
Say that the lie
Can't be right

If I could hold you
You know I would
If my whole world would just stop
Turning and be real still

I said I?d meet you after midnight
I know I never did return
A lot of promises were broken
I never kept to my word

I need to tell you I?m sorry
For everything that we?ve been through
I need to tell you I?m sorry
For all the love I never gave back to you

I?m sorry, I?m sorry
(Crawling on my knees for you)
I?m sorry, I?m sorry
I?m sorry, I?m sorry
(Feels like some Saturday cartoon)
