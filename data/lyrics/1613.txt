Party weirdo

God, am I the only sane one around here?
Don't anybody else find this queer?
Oh, shit, oh
A wizard approaches
A reward for the weirdo

Party weirdo
Party
Party weirdo
Countless times you have fallen, weird one
I'm gonna ask the judge for a party wack down
A weirdo crack down
Weirdo
Hanging out on streets in bars in cars
Outside my window
Weirdo
In my pool, in my bed, in my head [?]
Party weirdo
I simply ask the judge
For a party wack down

Hello hello hello
Hello hello hello
[?]
Oh, how cool
Party
Party
Party
Party

A wizard approaches
A reward for the weirdo
Oh but somehow someway somewhere
You get back on your partied out feet
Hello hello hello
Party weirdo
Party
Party weirdo
Party weirdo

Hello hello hello
It's just so exotic you got no where left to go
Party weirdo
Hello hello hello
You will ask yourself who am I what am I where am I
You will answer I am no-one probably nothing
Where am I? Where am I?
I know that I'm nowhere you poor crass animal ok I'm new around town
Can anybody tell me what all these party weirdos are all about
Someone says you must go there and check out the party weirdos
Now all I see is a lot of young people [?] all mixed up
It's just not fair
Countless times you have fallen weird one
Partied out yet

You might expect one's weirdness to subside

But it does not subside it sort of grows and grows and grows, man
Party weirdo
Party weirdo
Party weirdo
Party weirdo
Party
Party
You can just go find somewhere else to go
'cos you're just not welcome here any more
