We laid on the back on a latesummernight
When we ran out of words we could say
Like two stranded stars on a deepfrozen sky
So gone but afraid not to say
We counted the stars any latesummernight
And we watched their departure all day
"tomorrow we'll join 'em" we dreamt many times
But tomorrow was so far away
And the moon, and the stars
And the summernight sky
That dirty old barn, and the grey in our eyes
The harbour, the sea, and the rivers of plight
And still we're so far away...
And still we lay on the back
Another latesummernight
So gone but afraid not to stay
