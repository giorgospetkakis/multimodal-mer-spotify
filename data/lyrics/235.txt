[Verse 1]
Loneliness it shadows me
Quicker than darkness
Crawls to the surface of my skin
Visibly surrounded by it

[Pre-Chorus]
Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

[Verse 2]
Surrounded by empty souls
Artificial courage used
And because so, once was mine
I walk this maze alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

[Chorus]
The man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?

[Verse 3]
Chaos and hate shadow me
Pain it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel
Missing better half of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

[Chorus]
The man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?
