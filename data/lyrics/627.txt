[Verse 1]
Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again back is the incredible, the rhyme animal
The young cannibal, “D!”
Public Enemy, number one, "Five-O" said, "Freeze!"
And I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator-X spun
Now they got me in a cell, 'cause my records, they sell
‘Cause a brother like me said, "Well, Farrakhan's a prophet
And I think you ought to listen to what he can say to you
What you oughta do is follow for now
Power of the people say "make a miracle (D!)
Pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out (yeah y'all c'mon) here we go again

[Chorus]
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise

[Verse 2]
Never badder than bad
'Cause the brother is madder than mad at the fact
That's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
‘Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons, I'm saying inside music
That the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across
The country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait 'till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black
But we'll see if they'll play this

[Chorus]
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise

[Verse 3]
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, you know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, you know
You call them demos, but we ride limos too!
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on it's own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still I can rock bells ever
Forever Universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator-X it!

[Chorus]
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise

[Verse 4]
From coast to coast
So you stop being like a comatose
Stand my man
The beat's the same with a boost-toast
Rock with some pizazz, it will last, why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, you'll never get accepted as!
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got Flavor, Terminator!
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you!
