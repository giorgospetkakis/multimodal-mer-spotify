[Verse 1]
I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes
I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She is playing with her jewelry, she is putting up her hair
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

[Chorus]
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

[Verse 2]
I want a girl who gets up early (Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late (Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity (Uninterrupted)
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

[Chorus]
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket

[Verse 3]
I want a girl with a smooth liquidation (Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends (Good dividends)
At Citibank we will meet accidentally (Meet accidentally)
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen
She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She is changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She is trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron

[Chorus]
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket
