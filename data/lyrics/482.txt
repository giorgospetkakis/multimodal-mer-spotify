[Verse 1]
She said, "I'm going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn"
Oh, have mercy, my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Verse 2]
I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patr√≥n
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Verse 3]
Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Whoa

[Verse 4]
She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Outro]
She don't mean nothing
She's just having fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh, what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
