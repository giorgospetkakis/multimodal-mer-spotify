[Verse 1: Meric Long]
It's that time again
You want to leave me so I keep you home
It's that time again
You want to leave me don't you go

[Verse 2: Meric Long]
Let's go out again
Remember when I used to take you out?
Hit the town and then
Then maybe I can take you home

[Verse 3: Meric Long]
I fucked up again
You won't believe me when I tell you so
You won't let me win
Why can't you ever let it go?

[Verse 4: Meric Long]
Be my love again
Together we will have a happy home
Be my love and then
We'll never have to be alone
