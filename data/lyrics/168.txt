[Verse 1]
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
And I'll keep it like a burning
Longing from a distance

[Pre-Chorus]
I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known

[Chorus]
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh sadness, I'm your girl

[Verse 2]
These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight
I dream of times when you were mine so I
Can keep it like a haunting
Heart beating close to mine

[Chorus]
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh sadness, I'm your girl

[Bridge]
I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Every night I rant, I plead, I beg him not to go
Will sorrow be the only lover I can call my own?

[Chorus] [2x]
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh sadness, I'm your girl

[Outro]
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh sadness, I'm your girl
Oh sadness, I'm your girl
Oh sadness, I'm your girl
