I've shed these tears a hundred times
The bottles are broken, my well runs dry
All these painful words make this much harder
You have no place here, I've left and so should you, should you

These chains that bound me from this place
Tonight is the last night you will see my face
Left alone I've wandered in this place all night
This has to be the only way to make this right
Surely if I fell from these...

These chains that bound me from this place
Tonight is the last night you will see my face
Left alone I've wandered in this place all night
This has to be the only way to make this right
Surely if I fell from these...

I've held these tears a hundred times
The bottles are full and its my time to shine
Would you believe me if I told you...
It was my time to die
I've wished for this all night
So show yourself, I will fight, I will fight

Come at me with everything with everything you're made of
Come at with everything you've got

Come at me with everything with everything you're made of
Come at with everything you've got

All my life, I've waited for the day
When I could just drive
And get away from this place
I need to get away from this place
I know that I am better than this
I know that I am better than this
