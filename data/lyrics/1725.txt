Song:"The Truth"
Artist:India.Arie
C.D.:"Voyage To India"

Spoken : Let me tell you why I love him

[Chorus]
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie

Verse 1:
I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even,things I don't like about him are fine with me
Cause it's not hard for me to understand him cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes

[Chorus]
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)

Verse 2:
How can the same man that makes me so mad
Do you know what he did-(Spoken)
Turn right around and kiss me so soft
Girl do you know what he did-(Spoken)
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad no
Cause there's a blessin' in every lesson
And I'm glad that I knew him at all

[Chorus]
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie

Bridge, Break-down, & Ending :
I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
I love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal but most of all
It's unconditional

You know what I'm talking about-(Spoken)
That's the way I feel
And I always will-(Spoken)

There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or isn't
(Cause he is the truth)
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't
(Cause he is the truth)
Now you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly
Because he is, yes he is
I wonder does he know -Echoes
