River, did you bring me here
Touch me now, wipe away my fear

I will follow you along the river
There many years carved the way
I am reaching for love that's gone astray
Now I cannot sleep some days
Beyond faded tears I hide
I wish the rain would stay away

River, did you bring me here
Touch me now, wipe away my fear
River, miles and miles to flow
Shake this land, reap where sounds will grow

Now his love journeys on the river
Heart of darkness, endless trail
I am feeling the edge, can I be strong
Now I will believe your song
Beneath diamond skies I dream
Two lonely hearts no more belong

River, did you bring me here
Touch me now, wipe away my fear
River, miles and miles to flow
Shake this land, reap where sounds will grow
