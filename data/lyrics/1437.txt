I walked the line
Leave it all behind
I've been waiting forever
Lets go back in time
When I could read your mind
So long I've been waiting

It took the seasons going by
To know its not my fault

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
Tried to be everything but you

Its been so long
Since youve been home
I used to wait up forever
I used to say a prayer
Wishing you were there
And im still waiting

You told me once
You'd show up
But i fell for that
Before I fell to pieces
Then I woke up
To no one
Just a picture of Jesus
And a house left in pieces

It took the seasons going by
To know its not my fault

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
Tried to be everything but you

I wanted you
I need you
I want to believe you [x2]

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything but you

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
Tried to be everything but you
