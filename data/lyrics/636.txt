[Verse 1]
In space, the stars are no nearer
Just glitters like a morgue
And I dreamed I was a spaceman
Burned like a moth in a flame
And our world was so fucking gone

I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows
I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another

[Chorus]
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?

[Verse 2]
And hell was so cold
All the vases are so broken
And the roses tear our hands all open

Mother Mary, miscarry
But we pray just like insects
And the world is so ugly now

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another

[Chorus]
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?

[Bridge]
Because it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another

[Chorus]
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?
