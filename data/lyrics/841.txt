Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

Hey mann how d'you get in here
You're in my heart without consent

I always took pride in my selfcontrol
To my heart only I had the key

But something's gone wrong with my radar screen
You slipped by and you captured me

Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

Hey mann how d'you get in here
You're in my heart without consent

I've done all I could to keep my head clear
Logic tells me that this should never be

But there's no mistaking the shape I'm in
Love has filled my every waking day

Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

Hey mann how d'you get in here
You're in my heart without consent

Now hear, here's the strangest thing
The day has come I thought I'd never see

I walk smiling in a lightglow and I'm calling out your name
I've lost the battle and I'm quiet well pleased

Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

Hey mann how d'you get in here
You're in my heart

Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

Hey mann how d'you get in here
You're in my heart
