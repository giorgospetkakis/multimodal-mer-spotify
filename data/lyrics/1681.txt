Do me some wrong songs make money all the time, but your fine
Chocolate ass brings nothing negative to mind. The sun shines
Laughter when we live as one and there's peace for those who
Believe in love

I'm so glad we've come together again. Been thinking 'bout
You, where you been? I've been waiting here on needles and
Pins and I'm so glad we've come together again ' so glad
We've come together

Bad news makes the front page all the time, but the positive's
In small print on page 99. the sun shines laughter when we
Live as one, and there's peace for those who believe in love

I'm so glad we've come together again. Since the way and
Everything I have been laying low but it's good to see my
Friends and I'm so glad we've come together again ' so glad
We've come together

O why all the confusion, when there's such a simple solution?
In as much as we keep it to ourselves we all need each other so
Let's be together

I'm so glad we've come together again. 4.3.2.1
