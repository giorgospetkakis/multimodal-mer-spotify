Can you hear me stumbling, my friends?
'Cause suddenly the darkness became my friend
That strokes my head
Can you hear me counting the days?
'Cause every little second that passes by
Just hurts like hell
Leaving is my only choice
Will you cry for me?

'Cause all of the men that looked in your eyes
And all of the boys that lie at your feet
Forget how to breathe, forget how to speak
And all of them want you tonight
So hold me tight

Are you still around me, my friends
To hear that I have nothing to say to you?
For no one cares
I saw my face in a magazine
To state that my young eyelids just turned to grey
And no one minds
