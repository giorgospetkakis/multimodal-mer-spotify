And the time, yeah, the time will come
At least they say it does for some
Until then, cheers to better days
That will come, that will come our way

Seems like the world's still spinning round
'Cause the sun goes up and down
And when the early morning comes
It will be another one

Need to hear, need to hear you say
That's it's OK, it's OK
Come on now, we'll stay up all night
Waiting for the Northern Lights

Seems like the world's still spinning round
'Cause the sun goes up and down
And when the early morning comes
It will be another one
