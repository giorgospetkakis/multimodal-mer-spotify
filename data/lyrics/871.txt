Sebek, Sochet, Suchos
Dread lord of the marsh

He who crawleth amongst the sacred waters
And devoureth the flesh
Of that which is sacrificed
Unto Him

Tua Ashemu. Tua Ashemu
Rekhes Au Sebek. Rekhes Au Sebek
Tua Ashemu. Tua Ashemu

Sebek, Neter, Ashemu

Whose teeth rendeth and teareth with terrible violence
Restore the eyes of the dead
Collect their skulls
Join their bones together again

Lord of the temple of the mount of sunrise
Open the way unto the underworld
Cause the dead to rise to new life
Bring the child Horus upon the throne

Of Osiris
