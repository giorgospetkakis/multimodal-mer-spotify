[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:48]

[Verse 1]
I've got the answers
To all of your questions
If you've got the money
To pay me in gold
I will be living
In old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading
The secrets I sold

[Verse 2]
Daggers and contacts
And bright shiny limos
I've got a watch
That turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns
As poisonous cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

[Bridge]
The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash
Halo of flies

[Verse 3]
I crossed the ocean
Where no one would see
And I put a time-bomb
In your submarine
Goodbye to old friends
The secret's in hand
With phonied up papers
And counterfeit plans
You never will understand

[Instrumental outro 4:32-8:22]
