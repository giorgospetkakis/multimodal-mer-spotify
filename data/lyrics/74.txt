I used to laugh it off
I used to look the other way
I used to save them troubles for another day

I kept my fingers crossed
I used to never take the blame
I'd pull a sunshine story in the pouring rain
The more I had to change, I just stayed the same
The same, the same, I stayed the same

You don't know what you've got, 'til you're missing it a lot
I had to go throw it away
I was wrong from the start
From the bottom of my heart, I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful

I used to buy my time
I used to beat around the bush
I'd rather give my ego another push

I used to be a fool
It was a foolish game I played
And it's a fool's faith, common mistakes I made
Once I had it right, it was all too late
Too late, too late, too little too late

You don't know what you've got, 'til you're missing it a lot
I had to go throw it away
I was wrong from the start
From the bottom of my heart, I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful
It is hurtful, it's hurtful

What I did to you
What I did to you

What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful

I was wrong from the start
From the bottom of my heart, I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
And what I'm going through is hurtful
