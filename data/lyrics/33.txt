I made love to ya all night long
Then I got up to write you a song
I watched ya sleep and I fell in love
Ya must've been sent from heaven above
Don't think you could never do no wrong

Then you farted....
Oh girl you farted..

First I thought that it was kinda cute
I suppressed a smile when I heard your girly poot
Then came the smell came whoftin by
And brought a little tear drop to my eye
I think that I'll go sleep out on the couch

'Cause you farted...

You could make milk curdle
Make your skin crawl
Make the paint peal off of the wall
I won't sleep under the covers no more
Since the hot winds blew from out your back door

Baby, it sure has been a gas
But I can't live life in fear of your ass
So I gathered up my clothes and old dog bill
Moved back to my house at the top of the hill
Well old boy I guess its just you and me

Then he farted.....
