On the other side
Of these castle walls
Lies a world I'm not a part of
Forbidden to even think for myself
Dared to step outside the line
For fear of torture

I always wanted to know
How to kill a king
Use his madness against him
Forsake everything
Though his grip is so tight
And it's choking me
I will find a way out
Of this loyalty

Just when I thought I was
Running out of time
The King stood trembling at my bedside
He said "if you leave me now
My suicide will follow"
And I said "what are you waiting for?"

Now I know
How to kill a king
Now he suffers in silence
With a poisonous sting
He could not steal my might
And it seems to be
I have found a way out
Of his loyalty

I know that I can survive
Outside this cage
Maybe now I can fight through
All this rage

I'm so glad I knew
How to kill the King
I tore down the boundaries
And took off the ring
To reap what you sow
Is how it should be
There's no one left on the throne
Of this royalty
