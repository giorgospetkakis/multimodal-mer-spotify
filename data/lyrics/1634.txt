Air-conditioning is cold
Summer's hot and love is old
I wish I was smaller
A little creepy crawler

There's lovers' sin in this town
Lovers cannot lay down
The summer's hot as hell here you know
If we think we can drink now
We won't stop 'cause we don't know how
It's cold, but we love
How it feels so right

I sweat it all out, you sweat a lot too
We hurt the same, the same black and blue
Oh, I wanna catch my death of cold
Oh, 'cause I'm scared I'm growing old
Oh, don't return the love I gave
Oh, you're still my favorite

Troubles win in this town
Troubles don't turn upside down
They shit on the last bit of fun

There's sin all around
Lovers cannot lay down
And the winter wears and tears
Our bones

There's a man in this town
He's shooting us down
He thinks he's a big man but he doesn't know anything about us or anything at all

At night he lies awake
And his heart aches
'cause it's cold
He sweats it out all the night through
Then he throws up all over me and you

Oh, I wanna catch my death of cold
Oh, 'cause I'm scared of growing old
Oh, don't return the love I gave you
Oh, you're still my favorite

Air conditioning is cold
Summer's hot and love is old
I wish I was even smaller
A little creepy crawler
