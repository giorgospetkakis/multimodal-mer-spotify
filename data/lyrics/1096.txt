[Verse 1]
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to be again
An unhappy life working
Some kind of dead-end job
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

[Verse 2]
So lean to the side
Whisper it quiet
The end is in sight to working
All night around the clock
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

[Chorus]
But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

[Verse 3]
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
Move out of sight and onto
Some life I'm dreaming of
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
So I'll just wait and watch the wheels
While you're turning back

[Chorus]
But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

[Bridge 1]
It pulls me over and it drags me under
It pulls me over and it drags me under

[Verse 4]
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
An unhappy life working

[Bridge 2]
Alright now, alright now
Alright now, alright now

[Chorus]
But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

[Outro]
Alright now, alright now
I'll watch from the other side
Alright now, alright now
I'll watch from the other side
