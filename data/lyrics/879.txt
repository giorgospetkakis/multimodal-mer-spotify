[Verse 1]
Bonfires burning bright
Pumpkin faces in the night
I remember Halloween

Dead cats hanging from poles
Little dead are out in droves
I remember Halloween

Brown leafed vertigo
Where skeletal life is known
I remember Halloween

[Pre-Chorus]
This day, anything goes
Burning bodies hang from poles
I remember Halloween

[Chorus]
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween

[Verse 2]
Candy apples and razor blades
Little dead are soon in graves
I remember Halloween

[Pre-Chorus]
This day, anything goes
Burning bodies hang from poles
I remember Halloween

[Chorus]
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
