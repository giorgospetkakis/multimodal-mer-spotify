I remember hours scraped away
Hospital blue paint off the wall
Like it would take forever

Lighting those swan matches to see
Just how long they'll take to burn out
Like they could burn forever

How we envied all those actors lives
How that cricket talked all night
Like he could talk forever

Then I thought I'd heard you in the hall
Turns out that it wasn't you at all
I guess you had to be there

And I remember how fast we ran
I remember how fast we ran

We flew over fences
We dodged all the moving cars
And the dry Arizona faces
The dry Arizona faces

And how we stayed awake all night long
How we stayed awake all night long

We flew over fences
We dodged all the moving cars
And the dry Arizona faces
The dry Arizona faces
