Paralyzed by ancient delight
And riding for a fall today
I am dressed in style, so eager in mind
But furthermore distracted by you
And it's like i lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
Oh, i've got no clue how i could fight that
All that i am is worth a dime
Worth a dime

This liquid lunch will not stop my punch-
Drunk quality to doze while i run
It is thirty-nine degrees in my mind
It's thirty thousand miles more to go
Cause it's like i lose myself
In dreaming of summer days in bloom
For i've got no clue whatever happened
All that i am is worth a dime
Worth a dime
