[Verse 1]
You got out the wrong side of bed and liked it (Liked it)
The only love you get is unrequited (Requited)

[Pre-Chorus]
Mourning Monday all week long's not healthy
But being happy's only for the wealthy

[Chorus]
You can't see past the worst case scenario (Oh, oh!)
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
Oh!
(Oh-oh, oh-oh!)

[Verse 2]
Wallow in your miserableness as you tend to (Tend to)
You mastered looking unimpressed, do I offend you?
(Do I offend you?)

[Pre-Chorus]
M-m-m-mourning Monday all week long's not healthy
But being happy's only for the wealthy

[Chorus]
You can't see past the worst case scenario (Oh, oh!)
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
Pray one day, I'll live to see you break a smile
Whoa-oh-oh, pray one day, I'll live to see you break a smile

[Bridge]
(I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile)
(I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile)
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh!

[Outro]
You can't see past the worst case scenario (Oh, oh!)
You'd be happier instead if you'd stayed in bed
You can't see past the worst case scenario (Oh, oh!)
You'd be happier instead if you had stayed in bed!
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
Pray one day, I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
(You can't see past, you can't see past; scenario!)
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
(You can't see past, you can't see past)
Oh-oh, oh, o-oh, oh!
