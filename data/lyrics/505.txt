[Verse 1]
Claire had all but given up
When she and Edwin fell in love
She touched his face and shook her head
In disbelief she sighed and said
"In many dreams I've held you near
Now at last you're really here"

[Chorus]
Where've you been
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been
I'm just not myself when you're away

[Verse 2]
He asked her for her hand for life
Then she became a salesman's wife
He was home each night by eight
But one stormy evening he was late
Her frightened tears fell to the floor
Until his key turned in the door

[Chorus]
Where've you been
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been
I'm just not myself when you're away

[Bridge]
They'd never spent a night apart
For sixty years she heard him snore
Now they're in a hospital
In separate beds on different floors

[Verse 3]
Claire soon lost her memory, forgot the names of family
She never spoke a word again, and then one day they wheeled him in
He held her hand and stroked her hair
And in a fragile voice she said

[Chorus]
Where've you been
I've looked for you forever and a day
Where've you been
I'm just not myself when you're away

[Tag]
No I'm just not myself when you're away
