Hey Frankenstein, what’s on your mind?
Hey dracula, I heard you suck
Now Vincent Price was Dr. Phibes
Come steal my brain Fritz
And take it to Dr. Frankenstein

[pre-Chorus]
Well you can knock on that wood
But it won’t do you no good
No, no, no, no good
Cause all of my heroes are dead in Hollywood

Hey Norman Bates, how are your rates?
Hey Leatherface, remove my… face
Hey Tall Man, just take my hand
And lead me to your red planet

[pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
You’re so dead in, dead in Hollywood
Dead, you’re so dead in, dead in Hollywood

D.E.A.D. that’s how I wanna be

[pre-Chorus, chorus]

Whoa, dead in Hollywood
Whoa, dead in Hollywood
Whoa, dead in Hollywood
Whoa
