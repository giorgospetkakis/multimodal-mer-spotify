[Verse 1]
I can take a road
Takes a little longer
Walk before the house where we had our games
Suffering life, play, making, we discovered fire

People like you made me so much stronger
People like you made me question blame
Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire

[Bridge]
Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy
Hearing your voice makes me question fame
Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry

[Verse 2]
The language of loss made me so much older
The language of loss made me lose my grip
The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child

'cause everything moves in a shifting cycle
The unison soars and the pressure dips
Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile

[PreChorus]
And baby I know I will see you someday
Building your house on the very street
You severed your mother's life from your father's land

Finish your home we can join them this way
We talked about peace and a little dream
Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand

[Chorus]
And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth

[Bridge 2]
And I dreamed you were there
All the vital signs were standing
When I dreamed you were with me
With the summer at my back

And I dreamed you were there
So complete and undemanding
We know the love that gives
Is what the living always lack

[Chorus]
