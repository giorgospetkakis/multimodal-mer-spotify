How could I
Have led these men to their demise
And they just follow?
Exploration's last great prize
It wasn't mine

And mores the shame
You will remember my name

Great god
This is an awful place
And I do not think that we can hope
For any better things now
Oh the end
Cannot be far
It cannot be far
I cannot wait
Explorations last great prize
A saving grace
It wasn't mine

And mores the shame
You will remember my name
