Oh Girl
I want to see you tonight
Oh it's been days since I held your hand you know
It feels like years if you understand

Oh girl
Can you come over to my house?
Oh we can do things that we've never done
We can just talk it can be such fun

Oh darling
Oh won't you come and stand next to me
Oh let me whisper in you ear
People see then, I don't care

Oh girl
Can you come over tonight
Oh tell me those words that I want to hear
You can just whisper in my ear..

Don't you know that life depends on a night with only you?
Don't you think that you'd like to stay with me, too?
Because you can if you just take my hand
Come on girl, I'm waiting here for you
Because you can if you just take my hand
You know that it's true..

Oh Girl
The way you look it just blows my mind
All that I want is to be next to you
So tell me babe, what time's best for you

Oh Darling
Can you come over to my house?
Oh we can do things that we've never done
We can just talk it can be such fun

Don't you know that life depends on a night with only you
Don't you think that you'd like to stay with me, too
Because you can if you just take my hand
Come on girl, I'm waiting here for you
Because you can if you just take my hand
You know that it's true..

Oh-oh-oh

Don't you know that life depends on a night with only you?
Don't you think that you'd like to stay with me, too
Because you can if you just take my hand
Come on girl, I'm waiting here for you
Because you can if you just take my hand
You know that it's true..

Oh Girl
I want to see you tonight
Oh it's been days since I held your hand you know
It feels like years since you understand

Oh girl
Can you come over to my house?
Oh tell me those words that I want to hear
You can just whisper in my ear..

Oh Girl..
