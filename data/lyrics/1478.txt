Damn my lover, damn my child
Away my former days
Forty seven times I've been denied the life been dealt
Damn my lover, damn my child
Away I fall away
Forty seven times I've been denied
Damn my lover, damn my child
Away my father, away my...
Fortune never shined it's eyes the life you brought to me
Damn my body, damn my sight
Away my former days
Forty seventeen, I've been alive
Damn my lover, damn my child
Away my former days
Forty seven times I'm told to hand my bottles in
Damn my lover, damn my child
Away me for my bed
Forty seven times I'm told to hand my bottles in
(I was totally wrong
The morning arrives with new hope and optimism
After lengths of time that rapidly fade
Eventually, as always, the thoughts of better times give way to fear and inevitable conflict
Here we found ourselves, again)
