To be the motion actor
Two broken strings attract her
A groom, a face, a light-filled room
Hesitate to throw a coin in, a wish could be a bad thing
My mouth is just a mesh of drool

I'm standing on the bridge
I won't get hit from up high
A talking fish comes as she moves
I want to be like water
And never need a doctor
And carve the earth without my tools
(To-oool!)

All the things that I relate to well like  goggles and paint tubes
Transparent paper wings that float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
To think I'm dying, an I'm dying, I'm dyin'

The color after sunset
You'd do anything to jinx it
It'll crush your skull just like a willow
He doesn't need a house
His shoes can walk for miles
There's the drips, the black spots on my pillow

I want to be like water and slip into your throat
And make you feel alive and good
I want to be like water and '
Never have a doubt
And crack the hoods around my pool
(Po-oool!)

All the things that I relate to well like goggles and paint tubes
Transparent paper wings that float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
To think I'm dying, an' I'm dying, I'm dyin'

And all the dreams that I awake to read like postulatings
And all the things I hate I wish I didn't have to hate
To find a room that's natural
To live on by in 'em
By in 'em, by

I don't think you know just what you're doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving

When you wake up from your snoozin'
Gonna tell you how to do it my way
An' I'll tell you what I'm doin'
Lazy night I play my drum
Everybody talks bubbling
And I got no way to stop it
It's a song about the days you spend
Without me at our home

If I don't think you know just what you're doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving

When you wake up from your snoozin'
Gonna tell you how to do it my way
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
Lazy night I play my drum
Everybody talks bubbling
And I got no way to stop it
It's a song about the days you spend
Without me at our home (x3)
