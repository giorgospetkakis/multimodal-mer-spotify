[Verse 1]
The warmth of your love
Is like the warmth of the sun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

[Chorus]
Don't let go of my hand
Now darkness has gone
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget
The way you held me up when I was down
And I won't forget the way you said
"Darling I love you"
You gave me faith to go on

Now we're there and we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

[Verse 2]
The warmth of your smile
Smile for me, little one
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry
All your worried days are gone
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget
The way you held me up when I was down
And I won't forget the way you said
"Darling, I love you"
You gave me faith to go on

Now we're there and we've only just begun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

[Outro]
Yeah, we only just begun
Yeah, this will be our year
Took a long time to come
