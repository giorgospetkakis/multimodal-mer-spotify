[Verse 1]
I'm not quite how I should be
Been finding tricks too hard
I'm thinking something must be broken
Cos it wasn't like this before

Now everyone is ugly
And everyone is stoned
Small things about you excite me
But then I'd hate to spoil the tone

[Chorus]
All my little somethings just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers, dirty words and fighting talk
I'm so scared it's killed me time and time again
I can't live with compromise, so maybe we can talk as friends?
If at first you don't succeed, try again for me

[Verse 2]
Today is gonna be fine
Tomorrow will be fine too
I asked for things to better me
Even though they silenced my soul

I can taste it just for a second
And then it disappears
The flowers look like glitter
But then, so do you, my dear

[Chorus]
All my little somethings just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers, dirty words and fighting talk
I'm so scared it's killed me time and time again
I can't live with compromise, so maybe we can talk as friends?
If at first you don't succeed, try again for me

[Verse 3]
It's in the way that you look
It's in the books that won't read
It comes and goes like a friend
It's with me right till the end

It's in the memories I've lost
It's concentrating too much
It's breaking down of relations
And it's the beat of the clock

It's not being able to explain
Or get your feelings across
It's in the pain that won't leave you
It's coming straight back for us

It's in a new lease of life
And a search that ends well
It's in finding that change
It's being happy again
