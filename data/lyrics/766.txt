[Verse 1]
You get high, with your destructive instinct
You get high, with your corrosive instinct
Where can I go, to escape your foul mind trick?
You're trying it more, but you will never break me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just words to me

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me

[Verse 2]
Your designs, all the worse from power craving
Your desires, only where there's fire burning
I'll show you the way, a pleasure that's for the taking
You're trying it more, but you won't get satisfaction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just words to me

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Unreal what your hate's providing (say just words to me)
Your talk is always contradiction (say just words to me)
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you (say just words to me)
Is it true that there is worth inside, so say just words to me
