Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
Ill lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure

My dear dont you worry bout a thing
Ill be near to you all night
And through the evening
Ill be by your side

So Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
Ill lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure
(whistles)
While you slumber
In case you ever wonder
If a summer breeze just brushed your cheek
Know its me

And Goodnite
Close your eyes and just sleep tight
Ill lie awake and watch you dream
To be sure that all of your dreams are pure
