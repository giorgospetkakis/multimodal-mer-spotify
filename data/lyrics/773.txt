[Intro]
Maybe it's a rush
I'm not sure sometimes
I've given it everything
It just takes

[Verse 1]
Wanting, watching, debating
On which way to run to
Haunted, voices, craving
Someone to run to

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven’t lost myself in a long time
I never tried to care when I wanted to
I just want to be part of something
I just want to be real like you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I’m on my knees
You’re my favorite disease

[Post-Chorus]
I just need to get back
I need to get back to where I was
It can't be that far

[Verse 2]
Silent, warnings, tell me
That I’ve let things come undone
Show me, teach me the way to Heaven
'Cause no other way can

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven’t lost myself in a long time
I never tried to care when I wanted to
I just wanted to be part of something
I just wanted be real like you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I’m on my knees
You’re my favorite disease

[Bridge]
Closer, closer, closer to you
I need to be closer
Have closure and get closer to you
Every step I take

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I’m on my knees
You’re my favorite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I’m on my knees
You’re my favorite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me

[Outro]
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
