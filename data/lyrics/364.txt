[Verse 1]
It was meant to be, but all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why you didn't pass me by
Did you see me when your life flashed before your eyes?
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough, hard enough for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

[Chorus]
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
There's a world out there

[Verse 2]
Elementary, I solved them all, all your mysteries
Settle down and in good time, we can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when, tell me off again
I will let you know when I've had enough, had enough of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

[Chorus]
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)

[Bridge]
I know you've got your reasons, hey, let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still I get this feeling, no one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head

[Guitar Riff]

[Chorus]
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)
