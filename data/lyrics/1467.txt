[Verse 1]
Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Your eyes look red and hazy
Doing that stuff that you do
Messing me up with your voodoo

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie, boogie, boogie

[Verse 2]
Your lips are hot and spicy
Serving up red beans and rice
At midnight she's a' howling and stomping
Making love to the gators in the swamp

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie, boogie, boogie

[Verse 3]
I feel you now inside me
Never once did you deny me
Doin' that stuff that you do
Knockin' me out with your voodoo

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie

[Bridge]
Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Voodoo Lady, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Your eyes look red and hazy
Doing that stuff that you do
Messing me up with your voodoo

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie
