Mystery repeats
Life got tricks but its treats too
Blow my ass on the streets
Yo I see you

You lifted me
So I lifted you
Continue this beautiful cycle

History always tries to enlight you
How much been decided for you
You don't know
So just go
As far as you can go
But go slow

Hey yo

Know this i've noticed
What it is about all this
Seperating real from the fake and bogus
Sitting at the dock of the bay like Otis
We just slide,through this thing called life
Everything gon’ be alright
As you stay true to the path that’s inside

Mystery repeats x 4

What if i never went and smoked that first spliff
What if i never gave Sam that first kiss
What if i never even heard EPD
Would you still notice me?

What if i never heard Perq's first demo
Gave him a call "To the crib" ,(Hey dog)
Would i still been known as the fellow
Rolling with the dude with the cello

What if
These questions arise
As I look in my eyes
And I see my own surprise

Wondering what path lies before me
Probably the same as the ones before me
And i, Pass it right down to my seed

A mystery indeed
I'd tell him how proud i'll be
Go ahead make history

As the newborn start to breathe
As the widow starts to grieve
It seems that mystery repeats itself all over
As the newborn start to breathe
As the widow starts to grieve
It seems that mystery repeats itself all over
