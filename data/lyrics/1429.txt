Once upon a time, I drove my car to the station
I was getting my oil change
They done it in thirty minutes
They did a good job of changing my oil
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express
The oil change cost me fifteen dollars
The price was very affordable
The job was done
It was done right
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express
The oil change was finished
I was back on the road again
I was driving down the lane
I was fire walling the throttle
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express, Oil Express
Oil Express
Rock over London, Rock on Chicago
Allstate, you're in good hands
