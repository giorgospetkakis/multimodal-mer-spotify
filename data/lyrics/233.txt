Monday morning came too soon
It's entering my forgotten room
Disguised as the morning sun and I should be on the run
But I'm here
Waiting for you
To come and rescue me
From this awful blue

Looks like another day
In another way
Through another place
Too many lonely days
I'm not here for sure
Just here for more
You go on through that door
Cause I said I didn't need you anymore
Anymore...

Monday morning
Caught me by surprise
Covering up my weary eyes
Only helpless, not yet torn
Too many tears that I've worn
But I'm here
Waiting for you
Too come and rescue me
From this awful blue

Looks like another day
In another way
Through another place
Too many lonely days
I'm not here for sure
Just here for more
You go on through that door
Cause I said I didn't need you anymore
Anymore...

I said a lot of stupid stuff for sure
There's nothing I want more
This morning

Looks like another day
In another way
Through another place
Too many lonely days
Cause I'm not here for sure
Just here for more
You go on through that door

Looks like another day
In another way
Through another place
Too many lonely days
Cause I'm not here for sure
Just here for more
You go on through that door
