[Intro]
Lie down with me my dear, lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

[Verse 1]
My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

[Verse 2]
You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

[Interlude]
But Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

[Chorus]
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

[Post-Chorus]
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

[Chorus]
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

[Post-Chorus]
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind, no
