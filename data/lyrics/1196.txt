[Verse 1]
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And all your victims' pain will be avenged
Taker of innocence, I want your demise
Tear you apart for the unspeakable things you tried to hide
I fucking hate you
Every bone in my body will ache
'Till I destroy everything you love
And fill your life with their pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
I waited to erase all the memories
And you can't fucking stop me
My vengeance is finally born
Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And I have no mercy for your soul
Your blood is on my hands
Oooh!

[Chorus]
A call for blood for what you've done
No tolerance for what you've done
A call for blood for what you've done
No tolerance for what you've done

[Verse 2]
All their anguish
All their pain
All their nightmares
All their misery
It's all coming back to haunt you
Your time is up and you've nowhere to hide
I fucking hate you
Every bone in my body will ache
'Till I destroy everything you love
The only cure for your sickness lies within your grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
I waited to erase all the memories
And you can't fucking stop me
I hope you burn in hell
Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And I have no mercy for your soul
Your blood is on my hands
Oooh!

[Chorus]
A call for blood for what you've done
No tolerance for what you've done
A call for blood for what you've done
No fucking tolerance

[Breakdown]
Let the blood spill
Vengeance is born
Let the blood spill
Vengeance is born
A call for blood
