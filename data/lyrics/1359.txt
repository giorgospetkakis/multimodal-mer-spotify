[Verse 1]
Ch-Ch-Ch-Churchill, got his lucky number
Tomorrow there's another
Could be me, could be you
No silver spoon, sticky teeth, they rot too soon
You've got to have the best tunes
Or that's it, you've blown it

[Chorus]
All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
The likely lads are picking up the uglies
Yesterday, they were just puppies
Beery slurs, now life's a blur
Telly addicts, you should see them at it
Getting in a panic
Will we be there, Trafalgar Square?

[Chorus]
All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you
Should be me, should be you

[Verse 3]
But don't worry if it's not your lucky number
'Cause tomorrow there's another
Could be you, could be me

[Chorus]
All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you, oh-oh-oh
