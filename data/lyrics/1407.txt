You stop stopping by to say hello
You started starting up each time I phone
I only call when I get the blues
You think at least I could turn to you
But I'm sure your heart is breaking too

It's getting better every day
I still reserve the right to complain to you
That being said I rarely do
You left me with nothing left to lose
But I'm sure your heart is breaking too

I see you find the way to pass the time
"You'd like him, he's a lot like you"
I didn't see you getting saddled up so soon
"Babe, I know you'll find somebody too"
Maybe another week to recoup
"It's never easy but we'll make it through"
Yeah, I'm sure your heart is breaking too

I can't imagine how hard it's been
On second thought you don't seem to give a shit
You claim you're in pain but where's the bruise?
Yeah, I'm sure your heart is breaking too
