[Spoken Intro]
A'ight, so look
I know you think everything I say
I jus' be talkin'
It's a lotta B.S, I know (We keep, we keep, we keep, we keep, yeah, oh)
But we gotta stop goin' (Oh, we keep, we keep, we keep, we keep, yeah)
Back and forth, back and forth
Up and down, up and down
Round, round, round and round
If it's up to me
I'll make it happen

[Chorus]
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock it down (Time to lock it down)
And I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to settle down
Givin' up them girls on other sides of town
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

[Verse 1]
If a tornado swept through towns
We'd be goin' round and round
So many years that we stayed down
You sound like no other sound (No)
If I described my heart right now
Gotta turn my love side down
I'm on my knees, front of you right now
And I wanna make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Where will this road lead us right now?
Where we'll stop, nobody knows
We'll reach our pot of gold somehow
Just keep holdin' on
Like a merry-go-round
We keep, goin' around and round
We keep, we keep, goin' round and round
And I'm ready when you are, to let my game go

[Chorus]
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to lock you down)
And I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around (Round, round, round)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
Time to settle down (Time to settle down)
Givin' up them girls on other sides of town
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

[Verse 2]
It's like the spokes on an old 6-4
We be be goin' round and round
No one but you can hold this crown
So here's the plan, girl
I'm tradin' in my J's for some flip-flops
I'm spendin' all my nights here with you
We so wrapped up in this beat like it's hip-hop
I'm never gonna let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Where will this road lead us right now?
Where we'll stop, nobody knows
We'll reach our pot of gold somehow
Just keep holdin' on
Like a merry-go-round
We keep, goin' around and round
We keep, we keep, goin' round and round
And I'm ready when you are, to let my game go

[Chorus]
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock it down (Time to settle down)
And I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around (Only wantin' you be around)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
Time to settle down (Oh yeah, yeah)
Givin' up them girls on other sides of town (Other sides of town)
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

[Bridge]
Baby, the storm is over
Been through our worst together
Stoppin' us now, no ups and downs
We ain't goin' round and round no more

[Outro]
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock it down (Time to lock it down)
And I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town (Baby, yeah)
Only wantin' you to be around (Eh-hey)
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
(I'm givin' up my black book and numbers)
Time to settle down (I'm givin' you the love you deserve)
Givin' up them girls on other sides of town
(You ain't gotta worry about the others)
And justify this love that I found
(I'll cut 'em all loose and that's my word)
We be goin' round, and round and round
Ooh...
