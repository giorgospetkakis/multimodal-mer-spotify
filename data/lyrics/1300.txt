So late looking up at your window
As it bathes me in your
Blue midnight glow
I wonder why you're not sleeping
And I wonder
If you could know

Tonight
Make it tonight
Tonight
Make it tonight

Crouched down by a bush at the roadside
I watch as
You pass me by
Lost down by the side of the river
And no light comes
From the empty sky

Tonight
Make it tonight
Tonight
Make it tonight

I left home at midnight
Made for the horizon
No sense of direction
I walked on for miles
Oh I hope that I find you
I hide from the headlamps
No lights in the window
The whole town is sleeping and somewhere you lie
Oh, I wish I could find you
Oh I'm lost by the river
My clothes are in tatters
My face scarred by branches
I shiver with cold
No, I don't think I'll find you

Tonight
Make it tonight
Tonight
Make it tonight
Won't you make it tonight?
Oh say you'll meet me tonight
Won't you make it tonight?
Say you'll meet me tonight
