[Intro]
I'm killing the haughtily fly

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna slash your wound just like mine
I can't hear the voices of society anymore
I don't understand. You're all fine hypocrites

Shout The Joy

[Verse 2]
Your song's drenched in blood and it's full of shit
You can't shoot the silver bullet into me

Shout The Joy

[Pre-Hook]
It's the Black Flag, motherfucker !

[Chorus]
I wanna shout out to all the trash celebrity stars
I'll rape your daughter on your grave
I'll rape your daughter on your grave
I'll rape your daughter on your grave

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna slash your wound just like mine
I can't hear the voices of society anymore

[Bridge]x4
I Should Die!

[Pre-Hook]
It's the Black Flag, motherfucker!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Cold Blooded !
