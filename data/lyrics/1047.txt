Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what you're looking for

Baby
I wanna keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once, you'll beg for more

Oh, yes sir, I can boogie
But a I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

And yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

No sir
I don't feel very much like talking
No, neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance

Yes sir
Already told you in the first verse
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance

Oh, yes sir, I can boogie
But a need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

And yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

Oh, yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

And yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

Oh, yes sir, I can boogie
But as I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

And yes sir, I can boogie
