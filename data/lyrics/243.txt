You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light

You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stones
You might be so long together or you might walk alone
And you'll find that love comes easy
Or that love is always right
So even when the storm clouds gather you will be the light

And if you lose a parting side when love turns round on you
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light
You will be the light
You will be the light
