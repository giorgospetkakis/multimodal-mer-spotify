Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados and Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice, that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees
A steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well?
Let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel

Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray
You'd have to be a novice
To ever trust Venice
And those dreamy waterways
And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel

Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out
And that's just as well
I don't think we're quite ready
For Hawaii or Tahiti
And when we will be
Only time will tell
Let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel
