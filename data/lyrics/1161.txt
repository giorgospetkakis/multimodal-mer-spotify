[Verse 1]
Valmara, Valmara, Valmara flechettes
Kiss me with the lisp of your shrapnel caress
Lost this arm, lost this leg, lost a diving board
A belly flopped proposal of let's be friends

[Chorus]
Tour de force, tour de force
De facto
Ayachuco, Ayachuco, Ayachuco

[Verse 2]
Prosthetic, prosthetic, prosthetic blemish
Necro is the Velcro on the charred appendage
Cauterize solder gun in the melting of seeds
Oh, dear god, what a tangled web we weave

[Chorus]
Tour de force, tour de force
De facto
Ayachuco, Ayachuco, Ayachuco

[Bridge]
All we are are failed attempts
Propelled by stilt-leg presidents
Incarcerate the mason fence
Like flechettes, flechettes, flechettes

I'm not biting the lead, my pencil's broken again
We will fill in the blanks so you can cheat off your
Flechettes, flechettes

I'm not biting the lead, my pencil's broken again
We will fill in the blanks so I can cheat off your

[Chorus x2]
Tour de force, tour de force
De facto
Ayachuco, Ayachuco, Ayachuco

[Bridge]
All we are are failed attempts
Propelled by stilt-leg presidents
Incarcerate the mason fence
Like flechettes
