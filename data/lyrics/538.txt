[Intro]
I am Evan and this is my heart, I am Amy and this is my heart, I am Chris this is my heart, I am Torq
This is my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
How the heart bends, and summer she sends a sky that refuses to die
With weeds of the sea that wrap round our knees and a sun too hot to go down

[Chorus]
You come around, you come around, you come around, you come around, you come around, you come around
You come around

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]
