[Verse 1]
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
Oh, your will is in my hand

And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill

[Chorus]
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go

[Verse 2]
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
No, we don't dream anymore

Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Oh, my savior and my sin

[Chorus]
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go

[Verse 3]
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
Your strength is in my hand

And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill

[Chorus]
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go
