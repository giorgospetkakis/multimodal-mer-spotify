[Chorus][x2]
Coming down again, coming down again

[Verse 1]
Share your thoughts, there's nothing you can hide
She was dying to survive
I was caught, oh, taken for a ride
She was showing no surprise

[Chorus]
Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends, coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again

[Verse 2]
On the ground again, coming down again
Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie
Tasting better every time
She turned green and tried to make me cry
Being hungry, it ainâ€™t no crime

[Chorus]
Coming down again, coming down again
All my time's been spent, coming down again
