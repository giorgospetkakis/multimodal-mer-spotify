If somebody's askin', I've gone away
Yeah, somebody's packin and gone today
The summer was lovely and I enjoyed my stay
Maybe I'll be back one day

Sorry to hurry, but I'll miss my plane
Don't worry about me, I'll be okay
See ya the next time, maybe you'll stop by
Maybe, well I'll try
Hopefully, but I guess

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all, what really sucks is
Everything and all of us

So-and-so called me yesterday
So-and-so tells me that so's okay
I-don't-know took me far away
Hopefully, I'll be back one day

So many places, so many faces
Everything changes and everything's the same
So many places, so many faces
Everything changes, yeah, typical, but I guess

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us

Everything sucks
Everything sucks

I never cared that much, yeah
I never kept in touch, yeah
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
