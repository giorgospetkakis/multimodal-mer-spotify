In between we insidious vapors shalt teem
Looming so loathsome
And it seems to me like I'm dead inside
A bloated corpse propped out of tradition
I can never recall
What it was I had ever to strive for?
As a youth, was it just to exist autonomously?
No, we don't wanna work
We just wanna fuck, swallow pills, and forget our curses
No, we don't need pigs like you
We follow the laws of our emptying veins
In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed
Vampire youth
Raise your cups to the ne'er-waning moon
Let its visage ring true!
To the hearts cold and blue
We're dying each moment free
We're all animals here
Flesh and blood, bone and dream
We're just impulses here
Just another piece of shit in the storm
Just another piece of shit!
Shit!

From the smelling of things it appears
This shit has come to a boil
Nighttime we shall rule as our own
While this hollow will sleep
We shall bark at the moon
In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed
In this world there is nothing for us
But the sound, but the sound!
Vampire youth
Raise your cups to the ne'er-waning moon
Let its visage ring true!
To the hearts cold and blue
We're dying each moment
We'll never sleep again
We'll be going fucking mad
Sin and Hell is all we will ever know
Just another piece of shit
