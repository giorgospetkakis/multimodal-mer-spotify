And here we go again
We've taken it to the end
With every waking moment
We face this silent torment

I'd sacrifice
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Cause you know that I love you

Darkness is all I want to see
I could never put into words
What is it you mean to me

The candle is burning lower
At the window to my soul
The reaper is at my door now
He's come to take me home
