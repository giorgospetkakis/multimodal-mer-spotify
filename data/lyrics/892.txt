With my head against the window
Seal the letter which I did not sign
Should I wait for you for one last time

There's no end and no beginning
Every word comes like a silent scream
She told all the things I did not see

How could I know that she would lift me up to let me down
How could I know that you are all that really matters now
How could I know that forever wasn't quite so long

So where do I go now
Where do I go yeah, yeah
Where do I go yeah

She says nothing's everlasting
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do, what to say
I forgive you but I can not stay

How could I know I thought you'd wait for me but I was wrong
How could I know that you are all that really matters now
How could I know that forever wasn't quite so long

(repeat chorus)
She says nothing's everlasting......
