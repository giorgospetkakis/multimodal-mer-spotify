[Intro]
Ayo, R. Kelly, what's up, man?
You've been spending a lot of time with this girl, man
I don't know, man
She just got that vibe, you know what I'm saying?
Aiight, tell me the script
Aiight bet

[Chorus]
Vibe (hey), vibe (vibe), vibe (you've got that vibe)
You've got that vibe (you've got it)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, stop the press, girl, you turn me on
And I wonder if I could take you home
I must confess, the tight mini-skirt you wear
I just can't help it, baby, I can't help but stare, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Tell the DJ)
To pump it up a little more
Hey, girl
I gotta let you know that you've got that vibe

It's one o'clock and the party's just beginning
The place is jumping, ooh, what a lovely scene
Gotta let you know, let you know the deal
I want you now, baby and I'm for real, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Tell the DJ)
To pump it up a little more
Now, baby, I gotta let you know that
You've got that vibe

[Verse 3]
Yeah, how would you like to get a piece of this pie?
You could be my girl, and I could be your guy
Yeah, cuddle me in your arms like I'm your teddy bear
There, isn't that nice? You'll have no fear, yo
Kiss me you fool and make me melt like butter
When it comes to sayin', "I love you", I won't st-st-st-stuttter
I'll turn you on like a neon light
Make everything alright, like in the middle of the night
Yo, when you need somebody to love you
Like Flintstones, we'll have a yabbadabbadoo
Kiss and caress you and hold you and my word is bond
Yo, P. A. (wassup?) She's got that vibe, huh
