[Verse 1]
I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

[Chorus]
And I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
On my own
On my own

[Verse 2]
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

[Chorus]
And I won't feel afraid
No I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore


[Outro]
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
