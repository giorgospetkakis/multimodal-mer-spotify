[Chorus]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cause nothing else matters

[Verse 1]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we do it our way
All these words I don't just say
'Cause nothing else matters

[Bridge]
Never cared for what they do, no
Never cared for what they know, no
But I know

[Chorus]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cause nothing else matters

[Bridge]
Never cared for what they do, no
Never cared for what they know, no
Never cared for what they do, no
But I know

[Verse 2]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
'Cause nothing else matters, oh

[Chorus]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cause nothing else matters
'Cause nothing else matters
