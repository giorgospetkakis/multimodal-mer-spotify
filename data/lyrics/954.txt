This union made us powerless while talking over our heads
Claiming prosperity in a downward spiral plan
Stuck by deadly rhythm of the production line
Stuck by deadly rhythm of the production line

This power made us unionless while taking out of our hands
Cheapest labour at our expensive cost, auctioned our lives away
Stuck by deadly rhythm of the production line
Stuck by deadly rhythm of the production line

We [Incomprehensible] our lives like we are thankful
For what we are being forced into

Is it our duty to die for governments and for gods?
Is it our priviledge to slave for market and for industry?
Is it our right to follow laws set to scare and to oppress?
Is it our gift to stay in line and will it take away the blame?

We can no longer pay the price, we'll get organized
We will no longer believe, working for you will set us free
We can no longer pay the price, we'll get organized
We will no longer believe, working for you will set us free
