[Verse 1]
She's gonna pack her bags
She's gonna find her way
She's gonna get right out of this
She don't want New York
She don't want L.A
She's gonna find that special kiss
She don't want no sleep
She don't want no high
Oh, like peaches and cream
She's gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean?

[Pre Chorus]
She wants a good time, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight

[Verse 2]
So, she met this man, he was kind of rough
He said, "Girl, what you looking for?"
She said, "I don't know, I go with the flow"
He said, "Let's get on the floor"
He said, "You look real cute with your low ride jeans and your pink little baby tee
Let's get a room, girl
Come and ride with me"

[Pre Chorus]
She wants a good time, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight

[Bridge]
I must keep on moving
I must keep on moving
I must keep on moving
Who knew she could feel so alive?

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Outro]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
