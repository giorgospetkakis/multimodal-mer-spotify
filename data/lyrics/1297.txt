I couldn't sleep
Didn't want comforting
Just company to sleep

And then in dreams we meet
And stay asleep

I awoke feeling restless
Didn't know quite where I was
Though I felt far away and cold
It was so late but my mind was curious
It was quiet, snowing with frosted windows
I had a book but wasn't reading just watching you

Didn't want comforting
Just company, oh be sweet
It could go either way
Based on what they say

I didn't wish to be somewhere else
Your face was comforting to me
I don't remember you smiling
But just the same
I didn't know you
You didn't know what to make of me
It was peaceful that night
A kind of friendship all too serious
