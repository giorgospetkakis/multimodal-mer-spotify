When you're absolute beginners
It's a panoramic view
From her majesty Mount Zion
And the kingdom is for you

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

When you tumble upon that valley
Shark or sparrow line the stairs
When the arrows start descending
Then they scatter everywhere

On a bookshelf in Caledonia
Sits a map of passageways
Best to stumble upon Mount Zion
To behold the natural gates

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

They say the original sinners
Never felt a drop of pain
Until that second in the garden
Then they felt it each and every day

So draw back your bows, you hunters
Who have never felt that flame
All the absolute beginners
They are safe in the shade for today

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

When you're absolute beginners
It's a panoramic view
From her majesty Mount Zion
And the kingdom is for you

Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
