She's a movie star arrangement
Got a touch of Bergman to her face
She wears suits and buys him flowers
Smokes his cigarettes and bakes him cakes

He says uh oh i love you
But i'm not sure i trust you
You seem strange to me

She's got green eyes and she's lovely
Reminds me of the 'it' girl with her lips
Got an automatic license
Reads all Dostoievsky's household tips

He says uh oh i love you
But i'm not sure i trust you
You seem strange to me

How come everyone suspects her
Attach her to a lie detector
Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes
The needles on his polygraph test
Just go round in circles like his brain

She's got long hair but she's ugly
Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same

He says uh oh i love you
But i'm not sure i trust you
You seem strange to me

It took a thousand cliches just to scold her
Took a man from Stepford and a tape recorder
Got his ego broken, so crestfallen
You made a start, you made us laugh
Stop it. you're a grown man baby
It's just that your head's no good
