Girl

Who knows the things?
The one who knows
What are you dreaming of
Of open breast
Girl
Where did you stay so long
Girl
Where did you stay so long
I feel strong
The answer she gave
Simply was
I'll show you where the lilies grow
At the banks of Italy
There you eased my mind

Girl

Girl

You were so kind at the banks of italy
