This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

Loneliness
What a help you've been
This lonely days
You do the best to keep in

The tears and the rain
And the heartbreaks again
Only you will know

How the days go by
With no friendly hi's
And no friendly hello's

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

Loneliness
What a friend you've been
This lonely times
You try your best to hold in

The tears and the rain
And the heartbreaks again
Only you can know

How the years go by
With no friendly smiles
And no friendly hello's

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

Oh, ah, when you come
Bring the sun when you come
Oh, ah, when you come
Bring the sun when you come

Oh, ah, when you come
Bring the sun when you come
Oh, ah, when you come
Bring the sun when you come

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend

This loneliness
Ain't pretty no more
Loneliness
Only taking a place of a friend
