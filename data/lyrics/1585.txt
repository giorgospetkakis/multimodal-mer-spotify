It's not the cold making my legs shake
It's Timmy's ghost taking his place in our hearts forever

'Cause it's not the sound keeping me from sleep
It's what Jesus said, said about hell underneath
I think I'd rather believe in some imaginary place
Made up to make children behave
So our souls are safe to wander off
Wherever they might please
Your soul is safe wherever you might be

Come now, sleep
Come, now sleep

Tell me I'm only dreaming
Tell me he's just sleeping
And when morning comes
We'll both wake up to see the sun
And love that's enough to keep our friends alive

Phone call
I pull my car to the side of the road
No, it's not the cold making my legs shake
It's someone I love being taken away
A ghost taking his place in our hearts

Where inside he moves from room to room
But sometimes he climbs our spines
To remind our grieving heads
That in this way he hasn't left

Tell me I'm only dreaming
Tell me he's just sleeping
And when morning comes
We'll both wake up to see the sun
And love that's enough to keep our friends alive

Take me back to where I was before I was born
It's like sweet and dreamless sleep
It sounds like heaven to me
