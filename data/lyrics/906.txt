[Intro]
Kiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will do
Kiss, kiss kiss, kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will do

[Bridge]
Why death
Why Life
Warm hearts
Cold darts

[Bridge]
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
I'm bleeding inside

[Bridge]
It's a long, long story to tell
And I can only show you my hell

[Bridge]
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love
Just one touch, touch will do
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love
Just one touch, touch will do

[Bridge]
Why me
Why you
Broken mirror
White terror

[Bridge]
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love
I'm shaking inside
It's that faint, faint sound of the childhood bell
Ringing in my soul

[Outro]
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will do
