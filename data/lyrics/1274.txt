[Intro]
Hey...mmm-hmm-mmm
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me,listen to me, listen to me, listen...

[Verse 1]
I've been talking to this man
He's been saying what I like and
He makes me smile
When I'm down, so down
He says sweet things in my ear
All the things I needed to hear
But that's as far as it's gone
I promise, I promise

But I enjoy it, I love it so
'Cause it seems like I'm always alone
You're at arms reach
But baby, where are you?
Where are you?
'Cause I got this fire
Sweet and true
But I'm cold as ice around you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What happened to the wonderful thing we had?
It seems like you're missing in action
And I'm tired, I'm tired
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
I don't wanna lose this good life
But I ain't scared
If I'm going to be the only one participating in this

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around
'Cause I'm lonely
Whenever...
