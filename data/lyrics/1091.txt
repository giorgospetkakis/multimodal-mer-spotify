I miss those times
I miss those days
When you were around
So many ways
And it felt so safe
And I was glad
But now something's changed
That makes me sad

And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now, won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again

If you're doing fine
I don't know
You see, I gave up calling
Long time ago
Haven't heard from you
I guess that means
That I'm no good no more
That's what it seems

And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now, won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again

You see, I gave up waiting for you to care
You're not there
And I wonder if you ever were

And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now, won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again

And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now, won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again
