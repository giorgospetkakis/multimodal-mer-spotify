I play Hell, you play Heaven
I'm death's own little star
Can you trace the sins that haunt you
And play the Devil's cards as I do

I am all that you see
I am all that you want me to be

I am God for the Antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

I play death, you play alive
Triple sixes to rise
Can you see the visions I brought you
And the devilish games that I taught you

I am all that you see
I am all that you want me to be

I am God for the Antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

Synthetic generation
Stop not its indifference high
You must know

I am all that you see
I am all that you want me to be

I am God for the Antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

I am God for the Antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

I am God for the Antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

I am all of nothing
