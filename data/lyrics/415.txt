Destroy
Her body was destroyed
If you thought you were going to walk away from this without a scratch
You were wrong
You're going to taste my DNA whether you like it or not
Beg for your life
Or don't open your mouth
Your mother warned you about guys like me
Scream my name so the neighbors can hear
You can consider this evidence
Consider this evidence
A fucking nightmare
This is a fucking nightmare
And no amount of your screaming will ever wake you up
There was a bloodbath in this very room
A work of art that will be whispered about
I changed her from her neighbor's wet dream into his nightmare
She died a filthy whore
And the look on her face was fear
Destroy
Her body was destroyed
Just like your eyes being blown out from the inside
