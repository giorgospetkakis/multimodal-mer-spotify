He got away with thousands of dollars
He got away from the state police

He got away with emotional murder
He slipped away with the summer breeze

It's not fair
To call it a day
It's not fair
To just walk away
It's not fair
To bring me down
It's not fair
To leave a mess behind

He got away with the ultimate shakedown
He ran away from the scene of the crime

He got away from everyone in his way
Gone, and not a trace left behind

It's not fair
To catch me out
It's not fair
To leave me in doubt
No it's not fair
To not explain
It's not fair
To leave a mess behind

How'd you pull it off?
How'd you get away with it?
I never stood a chance
Oh you left me to die

It's not fair
To pull me down
It's not fair
To make me run around
No it's not fait
To not explain
It's not fair
To make me ask you why
To leave a mess behind
To make me ask you why
