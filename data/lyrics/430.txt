Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on

I've been around the world
To look for love from many souls
But at the wrong time
Searching for these vague elusive things
To keep and save
To ease my sad, sad mind

And I can belong
I can be anything I need
If only I had known
I'd face this world alone

Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on
Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on

Lying with my face away
From every pressure
Every day you'll find me
Clinging tightly to the stronger thoughts
The clearer picture
Friendly spots around me

And I could be loved
And I could be happy
If only I had known
I'd take these steps alone

Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on
Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on

If there's life beyond the daily grind
A vision for a broken mind
Can't find it
Fall from heaven, fall from grace
Come shelter in my barren place
Re-find it

A search for beauty
Search for friendship
Search for meaning in it all
If only I had known
I'd walk this world alone

Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on
Somebody
Somebody to lay your head on...
