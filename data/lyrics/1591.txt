Running so far ahead, just to get back to the end
There is something in our way
There is something I can't say
There's a wind behind everyone
It takes us through our lives
I wish I could have stayed
But this wind takes me away, away, away
One day we began
To fly again
And now we start
To fly & then
Running so far ahead, just to get back to the end
There is something in our way
There is something we can't say
There's a wind behind everyone
It takes us through our lives
I wish we could have stayed
But this wind takes us away, away, away
Oh, where do we go in these days?
Oh, where will we land?
