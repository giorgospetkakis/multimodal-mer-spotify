I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?
Situation gets rough, then I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
Hey, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it

[Chorus]
You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time!

I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?

I take 1, 1, 1 'cause you left me
And 2, 2, 2 for my family
And 3, 3, 3 for my heartache
And 4, 4, 4 for my headaches
And 5, 5, 5 for my lonely
And 6, 6, 6 for my sorrow
And 7, 7 n-n-n-n-no tomorrow
And 8, 8, I forget what 8 was for
But 9, 9, 9 for a lost god
And 10, 10, 10, 10 for everything, everything, everything, everything!

Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (do it all the time!)
Do it all the time (do it all the time!)
Do it all the time, time, time, time, time, t-time, time (do it all the time!)
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Do it all the time!
