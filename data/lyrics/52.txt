[Verse 1]
Are you moving much too fast?
And the good times that just don't last
If you're always on the go
Make an angel in the snow
And freeze

[Chorus]
Do you feel like you're stuck in time?
Forever waiting on that line
If nothing ever moves
Put that needle to the groove
And sing

[Verse 2]
Is it a dream keeping you awake?
Is it the stillness that makes you shake?
If you need to know for sure (need to know for sure)
What's on the ocean's floor (on the ocean's floor)
You'll sink

[Chorus]
Do you like things the way they seem?
Or are you looking behind the scenes?
Well, if you've gotta know (if you've gotta know)
What it takes to make it so (what it takes to make it so)
Just believe

[Verse 3]
Are there dark parts to your mind?
Hidden secrets left behind?
Where no one ever goes
But everybody knows
It's all right

[Outro]
Do you get dizzy on the ground?
It must be something going around
What blows us here today
It'll blow us all away
The breeze
Ahh, will blow us all away
The breeze
Ahh, will blow us all away
The breeze
