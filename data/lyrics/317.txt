If you know love, like I know love
The sun don't rise the same
When a heart sings, like a moonbeam
It shines on everything

If I told you, I was so sure
I woke up and love whispered your name
Well, baby believe it, I could not lie, if I tried

If you know love, like I know love
The birds don't sound the same
With your sweet smile, going on for miles
It warms up everything

If you told me, you were so sure
You found out that love had come to town
You don't second guess it, if you know love

Cotton candy and summer nights
String of pearls and city lights
I would throw them all away for love
Well yes I would

(Instrumental)

Lazy river and jambalaya
Pretty bubbles that caught my eye
I would give them all away for love
Well yes I would

If you know love, like I know love
The words won't sound the same
I have stumbled, I have wandered
And found sweet happiness

Well if I told you, I was so sure
I woke up and love whispered your name
Well baby believe it, if you know love

Well no way I second guess it, if you know love
If you know love
If you know, like I know love
