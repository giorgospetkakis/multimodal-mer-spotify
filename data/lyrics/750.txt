I am the voyeur laying next to you at night
Watching you when you sleep
I am your source of strength when it all falls down
And you're on your knees
And when the day comes and everybody's gone
You can call me a friend
I'll be here for your new beginnings and
I'll be here in the end
Here in the end

I'm gonna tell the world I love you, baby girl
Shout it out in the streets
Shout it out in the streets
Gonna talk about the joy you bring me, girl:
Look what you're doing to me

I am the shining star you see at night
When you're in the storm
Guiding you through the storm
I am the beating heart that's by your side
When you're in my arms
And when the day comes when everybody's long-gone
I'm watching you sleep
I'll be watching you sleep
You don't have to worry if you've got my heart
It's yours to keep
Yours to keep

I'm gonna tell the world I love you, baby girl
Shout it out in the streets
Shout it out in the streets
Gonna talk about the joy you bring me, girl:
Look what you're doing to me

I'm gonna tell the world I love you, baby girl
Shout it out in the streets
Gonna talk about the joy you bring me, girl:
Look what you're doing to me

There is love for all God's children
We all breathe in the same sun
We all sleep under the stars at night
We know that we are one
There is love for all God's children
We all breathe in the same sun
We all sleep under the stars at night
We know that we are one

And you're the one for me

I'm gonna tell the world I love you, baby girl
Shout it out in the streets
Shout it out in the streets
Gonna talk about the joy you bring me, girl:
Look what you're doing to me

I'm gonna tell the world I love you, baby girl
Shout it out in the streets
Gonna talk about the joy you bring me, girl:
Look what you're doing to me
