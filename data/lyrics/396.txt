I used to know this girl marie
And so the story goes, she never really talked to me
Her house was seven blocks away
On my way to school i went to see if shes ok

( chorus )
Tell me where have you gone where have you gone Marie
Why did you leave come back to me Cherie
I know you ran away you ran away Marie
You cannot stay you cannot stay Cherie
Please stay marie marie cherie.....
Oh no! He did not treat you right
Your in the senses lost, you never had a chance to fly
She looked so pretty like a dream
Her skin's likes velvet cream she never made her sweet sixteen
Nobody came around to see her it was as if she wasn't there
A lone butterfly that's caught in amber
Always your daddy's little girl

Chorus ( first chorus)
I know you ran away you ran away Marie
You can not stay tou can not stay Cherie
Tell me where have you gone where have you gone MArie
Why did you leave come back to me CHERIE
I know you ran
