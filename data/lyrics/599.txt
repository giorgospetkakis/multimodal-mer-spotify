In a room darkened
Like a calming plain
Draped longingly
Cleansing the body
The thoughts were focused
Necessitating sessions
Prepares herself
In a sea of wraps
An evenings conversation
Ends in a sea of slides
The reason for the taking
Slips into the turning tide
It all played quiet
With a portion saved
Building in vain
Open and staid
Ideas of purpose
Gesture with a finger
Angles drawn are limitless
An evening's conversation
Ends in a sea of slides
The reason for the taking
Slips into the turning tide
In a room darkened
Like a calming plain
Draped longingly
Cleansing the body
The thoughts were focused
Necessitating sessions
Prepares herself
In a sea of wraps
An evening's conversation
Ends in a sea of slides
The reason for the taking
Slips into the turning tide
