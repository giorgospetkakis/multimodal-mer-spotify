Hello my old friend
It's been awhile
All our old clothes
Are back in style
We went our separate ways
Only to return
To face a lesson
We failed to learn

We didn't understand the truth
We were blinded by the eyes of youth
But time kept on moving
And a change has come
You think that I don't know
Where you're coming from

Well I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin
I'm just like you

You gave your love and your innocence
And they took away your confidence
Well I'm not those women
I'm not those men
Put your arms around me
I am your friend

'Cause I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin
I'm just like you...

You and everybody else
When I get hurt
I cry for help
And I've got secrets
That god only knows
And god knows I feel...
Just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin
I'm just like you

I feel just like you
And i cry just like you
I heal just like you
And i break down just like you
I feel just like you...
And i cry just like you
But im weak just like you
And under my skin...
Im just like you...
