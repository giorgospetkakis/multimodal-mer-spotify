Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right

When I first met you
You was livin' in your Dae Woo
You were wearin' chit-chat shoes
You were illin' on voo doo
Yeah, you were tryin' to hex me
All tellin' me I'm sexy
Yeah, always tryin' to text me
Or dance next to me
Sayin'...

Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right
Don't be scared to fall in love
Cos you don't like heights
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right

So now you're on my bedroom
All talkin' bout some boom boom
But you really shouldn't assume
Cos my man is coming home soon
He ain't tryin' to have a rival
You best think of your survival
Yeah, I ain't tryin' to be liable
I swear it on the Bible
I swear it on the Bible

Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right
Don't be scared to fall in love
Cos you don't like heights
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right

Alright, hello?
(Hello, this is your body.)
What do you want, my body?
(I wanna feel somebody on me.)
