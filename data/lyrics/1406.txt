[Chorus]
Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

[Verse 1]
Where the cool winds blow
I must surely go
For my love calls me low to drag her from the depths of my soul
When will I see her, again?
The other-side, of friends
The darkened claws, of death
The empty breath, desire

[Chorus]
Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

[Verse 2]
Restless in my speech
And rootless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt of her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen, again
No other lovers, to bend
Just rotten apples, to eat
Just lettered, yellowed distant scorn

[Chorus]
Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

[Outro]
Life just fades away, purity just begs
Dust to dust, we're wired into sadness..
