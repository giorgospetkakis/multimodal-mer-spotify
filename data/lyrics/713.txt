I can feel you
Slippin' through my hands
And I can't stop it
And that's what gets me scared
It's in my leaving
That the sames begin to tear
But we made it once
And we'll make it through again

CHORUS:
And Hey, We'll be fine just like the last time, baby
And you say, we'll be fine just like the last time
Fine just like the last time, baby
I can't tell you
What you mean to me
You're my constant
You're my consistancy
Everyone's changing
I barely recognize this town
You gotta promise me
That you'll always be around
