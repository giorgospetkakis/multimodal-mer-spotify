[Verse 1]
People get around
This is a part for you
If you come undone
Then this is what you do

[Chorus]
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about
If you can't say no just think about me

[Verse 2]
I know that you are in love with me
But I also know your kind
Well, baby you got a lot of nerve
So just try to keep me in mind, oh oh

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You went with another man
And I cried when I read your letter
But I don't really want to know
Where you've gone
Or if it was better, yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You went with another man
And I cried when I read your letter
But I don't really want to know
Where you've gone
Or if it was better, yeah yeah

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro (throughout Chorus)]
If you can't say no, if you can't say no, no, no, no
If you can't say no just think about me
Me, me, me, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you can't say no, just think about me
Think about me
Think about me
Think about me
Just think about me
Think about me
Just think about me
Think about me
Just think about me
