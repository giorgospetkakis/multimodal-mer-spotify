[Chorus]
Tried for so long
For you to hold on
But you won't be long to anyone
Anything, any love at all

[Verse 1]
I thought we had it all until things started to recede
Giving me no love at all not caring enough about my needs
Gave you my heart and all my soul but not once did I let go
And I tried to stick by you and I tried to call to let you know
That I'm here for you and I'm give my all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You had the best love of you life
But you didn't treat it right, no you didn't, no you didn't girl
To busy running out all night long, didn't even have the decency to pick up the telephone
And call me, and let me know where you were
And that your alright, so I could sleep at night
Girl you showed out so
Had the nerve to break up our happy home
All I wanted to do for was let you know

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I stood by your side, sheltered for you
When things were down, I help pull you through
Faithful and all, trusting and warm
But you took heart by storm

[Chorus]
