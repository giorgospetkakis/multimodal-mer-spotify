Locked inside this cage
Where all your world's a stage
And in this silent rage
Can you turn the page into something new
The fantasies of burdened beasts
But kings and queens won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
Then someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

No more screams or shouts
You're quiet as a mouse
And in this slaughterhouse
Is there no way out of here
They feed the fears and hide the griefs of burdened beasts
Cause kings and queens won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday he might lose his crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free
Would set me free

Don't look back and don't look down
You'll fall into that wishing well
You're frozen under someone's spell
That keeps you running in and out of luck

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday he might lose his crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free
Would set me free
