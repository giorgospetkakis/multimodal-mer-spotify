I feel like I am dirt to you
You hate me cause I love you
Just tell me why I'm so low to you
Didn't I mean anything

Your happiness is my sorrow
My sorrow is my way
My life is a failure
Growing bigger everyday

Does it make you happy to see me sad
To break my heart and leave

Here we are
You and I
In the sun
In the sun we're gone
