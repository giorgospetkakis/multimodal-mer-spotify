I hold a picture in my hand
And though I understand
I'm drifting into space
Your eyes are covered by a cloud
Containing all your doubts
You held your lies with grace

I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me

The Sunday mornings on your own
I guess I should have known
But trust had blinded me
I guess I knew it all the time
When he was on your mind
I never had a chance

I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me

She fades away to a land far away
She takes no time to explain why she goes

I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
I'm not the one for you
I'm not the one for you
You are the one for me
