I've got no good in me
For anybody
I've been ruined by the lies
I told to everybody
It's so desperately sad
That my life has come to this
I hope there's something better
Than this for me

I used to think
I had something to say
But my dumb ideologies
Gave me away
I keep my mouth shut
But it's always the same
Over and over and over again

Today I am wrong again
But it's not surprising
Once more heaven
Has forgotten me
So everybody
Clap your hands together for me
As I watch my world collapse
Don't waste your sympathy on me
Because I made it all up

I used to think
I had something to say
But my dumb ideologies
Gave me away
I keep my mouth shut
But it's always the same
Over and over and over again

My mistakes happen
So much it's successs
But I drag you all down
Into my sorry mess
I said i was sorry but
It's always the same
Over and over and over again

I have been doomed
From the first time I tried
To find something to save me
From all of my lies
I'm always fake
And it's always the same
Over and over and over and over again
