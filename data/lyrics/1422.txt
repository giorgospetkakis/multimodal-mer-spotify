In the midst of my swing
Swaying my rose white strings
I am hacking the wind with my wings

I am closing my eyes
I am flying to restless night
The angels they smile on my flight

I am safe from my dreams
I am casting my favourite sins
I want to believe this is real
Shining in the night
Diamonds in the sky
Sweet dreams in the girl's paradise

Its no way to sing
Playing my tambourine
Feeling the pinch on my skin

I am closer to sky
Diamonds are flying high
Demons require my right

Shining the night
Diamonds in the sky
Sweet dreams in girls paradise

Shining the night
Diamonds in the sky
Sweet dreams in girl's paradise
