That sky is a-shine with sheen
Those eyes are a green machine
Spare me your whining
In my rainy gazebo tree

Deep in my silver pit
The walls are all thick with it
My, but you slay me
In my rainy gazebo tree

Bless my baby eyes
Don't you know Jesus died?
I'm better off inside
Strip and you lose your hide

What's in that Thermos, man?
Your female's a garbage can
So you haven't filled her up
Okay, try to fill my cup
It's moonshine from cactus
Well, I guess it can't wreck us

Bless my baby eyes
Don't you know Jesus died?
I'm better off inside
Strip and you lose your hide

Bless my baby eyes
Don't you know Jesus died?
Spare me your moon shining
In my rainy gazebo tree
In my rainy gazebo tree
In my rainy gazebo tree
