[Verse]
You snake, you crawl between my legs
Said want it all it's yours you bet
I'll make you queen of everything
No need for God, no need for Him
Just take my hand you'll be my bride
Just take that fruit put it inside
You snake, you dog, you fake, you liar
I've burned my hands, I'm in the fire
You salty dog, you filthy liar
My heart it aches, I'm in the fire
You snake, I ate a true belief
You're rotten fruit inside of me
Oh, Adam, please you must believe

[Outro]
That snake put it in front of me
That snake put it in front of me
In front of me
