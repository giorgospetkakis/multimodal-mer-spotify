Wake up rock star, you've gone too far
Now there's no way back alone

If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening?
If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening?

Wake up driver, speeds not armour
Now there's no way back alone

If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening?
If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening?

If you go, if you go
I will tear this place apart
If you go, if you go
I will earn this bleeding heart
If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening?

So don't you let me down
Don't you turn your head
I have earned the right to be in this bed
I'm in Shangri-la, I'm in reverie
But all the time I'd rather be

If you go, if you go
I will tear this p[lace apart
If you go, if you go
I will earn this bleeding heart
If you go, if you go
I'll be calling on your radio
Is anyone listening
