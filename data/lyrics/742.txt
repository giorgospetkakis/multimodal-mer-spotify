[Verse 1]
You never said, you never said, you never said that it would be this hard
Love is meant to be forever, now or never seems to discard
There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars
So can you hear me when I call your name?

[Chorus 1]
And when you fall apart, am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart, your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?
When I call your name

[Verse 2]
Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong
And I've been standing in the river of deliverance way too long
There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars
So can you hear me when I call your name?
So can you hear me when I call your name?

[Chorus 1]
And when you fall apart, am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart, your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

[Chorus 2]
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name

[Chorus 1]
And when you fall apart, am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart, your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?
And when you fall apart, am I the reason for your endless sorrow?
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart, your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?
When I call your name
