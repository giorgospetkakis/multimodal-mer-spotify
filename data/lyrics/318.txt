Crawling through the minefield
We never saw the signs
The lightning flashes thunder claps
Oh is it just a dream Ophelia
Saw the dark clouds rolling
Scavengers revolving as we
Made love on a log in the fog
Is it just a dream Ophelia
There was just a hint of searchlight
It illuminates a pair of lonely souls locked together
Is it just our dream Ophelia
Trying hard to hide
To melt away but rolling for a
Gallery of eyes
Watching waiting
Is it just our dream Ophelia
And love is blind
It cracks its stick across our fingers
Makes us bleed It makes us sick
Is it just our dream Ophelia
Water's boiling but the need is strong
And we have to swim
Let's find an island find a log
That maybe we'll call home
Our home Ophelia
Do you think that we can make it on our own
Our dream Ophelia
