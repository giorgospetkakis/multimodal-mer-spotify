[Verse 1]
I got to have a shot
Cause what you got is oh so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang I need a repeat

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

[Verse 2]
You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You got to move it up
And use it like a screwball would
You got to pack it up
Work it like a new boy should

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
