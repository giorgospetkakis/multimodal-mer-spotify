He still held my hand in his thread
His head filled with helium
Pulled me up so i couldn't walk
But look at things from a different angle

To hang on to my balloon
And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and i laught "such a rare, rare joy"

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said
"I have to move further on, i'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view"

I fell down on a cottonpavement painted blue
And i lost the sight, lost the moment and my view
The only truth that I knew, moments swiftly disappear
