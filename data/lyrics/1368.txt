Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Some people say that I want you for your money
But I really want for your body
(Yes, no, yes)
Pleased to meet you, baby
I want to be your honey
So let's go tell your daddy and mommy
(Yes, no, yes)

This won't get any easier
Now that your heart is beating in my hand
I'll try not to destroy you, baby
Even though we both know I can
Oh, you know I can

Make love with the lights on, baby
Tell me what you see
Clear the bed to lie on, darlin'
Make a mess of me
Here's my dress to try on, baby
Let me be your man
I will call you pretty, darlin'
Tell me what I am

Oh, oh, oh
C-c-can I have your number?
Can I have your baby?
Can we run away together?
(Yes, no, yes)
I would walk on water
I would walk on fire
I would sell my soul to the devil
(Yes, no, yes)

And this won't get any easier
Now that your heart is beating in my hand
I'll try not to destroy you, baby
Even though we both know I can
Oh, you know I can

Make love with the lights on, baby
Tell me what you see
Clear the bed to lie on, darlin'
Make a mess of me
Here's my dress to try on, baby
Let me be your man
I will call you pretty, darlin'
Tell me what I am

(Yes, no, yes)
(Yes, no, yes)
(Yes, no, yes)
(Yes, no, yes)

Make love with the lights on, baby
Tell me what you see
Clear the bed to lie on, darlin'
Make a mess of me
Here's my dress to try on, baby
Let me be your man
I will call you pretty, darlin'
Tell me what I am
