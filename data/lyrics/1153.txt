[Verse 1]
I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the loving I've been missing
Lately, baby, I ain't had no kissing
Don't you love me?
Can we stay together?

[Pre-Chorus]
Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing (what a good thing)
But now you've turned around
Don't you care how this love we've had turns out?

[Chorus]
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever

[Verse 2]
We can work at our love
And make it all brand-new
If we stay together
There's nothing we can't do
Improve the loving is what I'm seeing
Let's do it, baby
Don't fight the feeling
Won't you love me?
Can we stay together?

[Pre-Chorus]
Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing (what a good thing)
And now you've turned around
Don't you even care how this love we've had turns out?

[Chorus]
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
Promise me, you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
