Look out to the calm sea
I don't know why that I
want to cry when I feel this high

Nature seems to know me
So many times she's been below me
And so I sit and we dream
As my soul she tries to lift

Seems I lost my way last night
But I was reborn by daylight
Seems I get another chance
Another chance to dance away

Now you bring your loving back
But don't you know your love is black
And now you're here pouring in the dark
Because you can't see inside my heart

My heart, my heart

Look out, your love is black
Look out, your love is black
Look out, your love is black

Close my eyes and I can't breathe, I can't feel
What is right, what is true, what is real

Seems you lost your way last night
But you were back here by daylight
Now your words are black and cold
And your lines are tired and old

Nature is calming me
Because your love was harming me
And now I shed that coat of harm
I wasn't safe there in your arms

Look out, your love is black
Look out, your love is black
Look out, your love is black
Lost my way

It's true I loved you once
It's true you were once mine
I lost my way

I lost my way, lost my way
Because I lost my way
I lost my way, I lost my way
Lost my way, lost my way
