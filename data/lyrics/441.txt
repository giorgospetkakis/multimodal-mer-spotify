At the end of my days when I'm called to go
Into the open arms of the Holy Ghost
To have lived such a life as I have known
Fortune follows me, but I'm brave no more

For my great mistakes I will surely pay
I'm running low and the devil is on my trail
When fate delivers me all I'll ask it for
Is a place to rest and shelter for my soul

Oh if I could spend my days
Free from the prison of your gates
Then I could die a happy man

Oh if I could spend my days
Free from the shadow of my name
Then I could die happy man

When I am released from this mortal load
I'll take my leave but I don't wanna go
When fate delivers me all I'll ask it for
A place to rest and shelter for my soul
