[Verse 1]
Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

[Chorus 1]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

[Verse 2]
You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

[Chorus 2]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

And you're the one, there's no-one else
It makes me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

[Bridge]
Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine

[Verse 3]
Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants, the soul waits

[Chorus 3]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

For love and faith and sex and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

[Outro]
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
