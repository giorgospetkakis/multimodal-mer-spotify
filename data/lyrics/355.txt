[Verse 1]
These four walls of Farnsworth
Are closing' in on me
My final meal's over
They're going to set me free
I can feel the fire's a burning'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jailhouse floor

[Chorus]
Lord, now I'm singing':
"Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For living' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgment day

[Verse 2]
Every life owes a debt
That's what the Bible says
I owe mine to this state
For shooting' that boy to death
A liquor store attendant
He was reaching' for his gun
Now his Momma sits there smiling'
As the boss yells "Roll on one

[Chorus]
Lord, now I'm singing':
"Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For living' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgment day

[Verse 3]
A hungry blue eyed baby crying'
Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dying'
I dropped my pistol on the floor
Yeah, I'd take it all back but there's nothing' I can do
They've covered my face
An' the order's gone through
As the boss yells "Roll on, two"
Now I'm flying'
Up an' out of here
I close my eyes an' slowly rise
Let my body leave this chair
Lord I hope you forgive me
For living' my life this way
Yeah, tonight I ride the lightning
To my final resting' place
These four walls of Farnworth
Are closing' in on me
