Suck my left one

Sister, sister where did we go wrong?
Tell me what the fuck we're doing here
Why are all the boys acting strange?
We've got to show them we're worse than queer

1, 2, 3, 4
Suck my left one
Suck my left one

Daddy comes into her room at night
He's got more than talking on his mind
My sister pulls the covers down
She reaches over, flicks on the light
She says to him

Suck my left one
Suck my left one

Mama says:
You have to be a polite girl
You have got to be polite
Show a little respect for your father
Wait untill your father gets home
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
