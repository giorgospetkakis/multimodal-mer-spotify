All my life I've been fall- fall- falling apart
Been tumbling down quick, fast right from the start
I never learned just get up and go on
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

Stumbling with every step I take
And it seems I can't get a grip
I'm soon gonna slip
And then I look down
I see that the ground
Is closing in fast again
And then boom

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

Fall fall fall fall fall fall falling apart
Fall fall fall fall fall fall falling apart
Fall fall fall fall fall fall falling apart
Fall fall fall fall fall fall falling apart

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
