[Everybody]
C'mon, it's such a joy, c'mon you metal boy
C'mon let's take it easy
C'mon let's make it sleazy
Take it easy! Make it sleazy
Everybody's got a ticket to ride
Except for me and my lightning
Your insides ooze out, the electrodes are in
The electrodes are in so your eyeballs pop out
Someone controlling me
Can't be happening to me
Take it easy! Make it fuckin' sleazy
Everybody's got a ticket to ride
Except for me and my lightning
Sweat-chilling cold, I watch death unfold
How true is this? Get it over with
So come on!
Take it easy! Make it leazy
Everybody's got a ticket to ride
Except for me and my lightning
Come on! Come on! I said come on!

[Ticket]
I think I'm gonna be dead, I think it's today
Electric wires pinned to my head, I'm frying away
I've got a ticket to ride
I've got a ticket to ri-i-i-ide
I've got a ticket to ride the lightning, yeah!
Death is in the air, it's bringing me down
Strapped in the electric chair, death is all around
Yo, I've got a ticket to ride
I've got a ticket to ri-i-i-ide
I've got a ticket to ride the lightning, yeah!
Before I get to riding so high
Someone help me, oh please God help me
Flashing before my eyes
Someone help me, oh please God help me
Wakened by horrid scream burning in my brain
Freed from this frightening dream
I can feel the flame
I've got a ticket to ride
I've got a ticket to ri-i-i-ide
I've got a ticket to ride the lightning, yeah!
