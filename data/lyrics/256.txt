The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day
The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day

(Turn it up, let's get this started again man)

I need to find myself again, to much of my life is spent on the weekend
Now here comes Monday again, I don't feel great cuz I can't pretend
That the night time hasn't come to got the upper hand
While I'm movin' through the world and I'm movin' through the land
You might make money and you might make grand
You're alone on your own two feet you've gotta stand
Life suck you say the? Will leave you empty
And he's right, and I've done plenty
Sometimes I wonder what the lord sent me
Shit
Fulfill your dreams, keep up the schemes
You've got your family you've got your team
Stay on top and learn from what you've seen
Cuz if there's dirt it can always be clean

The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day
The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day

I need to get myself on track
Cuz the bangs underneath my eyes are lookin' black
Pressure comin' down could result in gettin' slacked
But I gotta stop the demons from gettin' on my back
Night time cruise into daytime
And everybody's hanging where I'm looking for the next line
Throw it all up continue to shine somehow
Next thing now

Let the beats go out
What's happening now
Somehow, someway, next day, what do you say?

The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day
The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day

I need to make myself a plan
Cuz I don't wanna end up an angry man
Lookin' in my past and thinkin', damn
Forty years old with nothing in my hand
Close your palm it could slip like sand
If you don't respect and understand
What's been put out in front of you
Stop a little while let me? What I'm comin' to
Got some stuff that I don't wanna hand to you
So I'm sittin' in my laugh for a month or two
Payday, Friday, time to wash all your worries away
Now all listen in to the music we play
Like Sinatra, we do it our way

(Your way, my way, whos way?)

The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day
The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day
