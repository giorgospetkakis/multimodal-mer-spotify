[Verse 1: Marla Hansen]
Did you hurt your hand again
Last night when you fell in the snow?

[Verse 2: Marla Hansen]
Shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle
Shuffle your feet
Without looking down
You know how to place your feet
Carefully
On the ground

[Chorus: Marla Hansen & Sufjan Stevens]
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you say, lighten up
Lighten up

[Verse 3: Marla Hansen]
But here it's dangerous, not like home
You never know what might be under the snow

[Chorus: Marla Hansen & Sufjan Stevens]
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you say, lighten up
Lighten up

[Verse 4: Marla Hansen]
Tomorrow when we walk in the cold
Keep hold of your hand 'cos you know
I like it so when
If you push me down
I will try not to care about what might
Be under there

[Alternate Chorus: Marla Hansen & Sufjan Stevens]
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you know, lighten up
Lighten up
