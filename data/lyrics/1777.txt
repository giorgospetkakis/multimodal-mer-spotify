Yeah. You're either gonna like this song, or kick my ass after the show

You're the love of my life
But it cuts like a knife
And I feel that I'm being misled
See, I'm a little concerned
For I've recently learned
Of the swastika tattoo on your head

And it makes you smile
When you hear "Sieg Heil"
You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard
You do goose-step salutes
In your Doc Martin boots
And you quoted "Mein Kampf" in our 5th anniversary card

I think you're a nazi, baby
Are you a nazi?
You might be a nazi, baby...

You keep extensive files
On the Nuremberg trials
And you watch them whenever they're airing
I guess I should've known
When you bought a new bone
For your puppies named Göbbles and Göring

You showed up late
To our very first date;
I said, "How are you?", you said, "White power"
Call me paranoid
But I'm not overjoyed
When you ask me if I want to shower...

I think you're a nazi
Don't be lyin', baby
Are you a nazi?
Are you anti-Zion, baby?

Your every dress
Is monagrammed "SS"
You hold an Aryan picknick and bash
And it makes me irate
When you say I look great
When I wear a little tiny moustache

Your social politics
Say that races don't mix
And you call it pure-blood pollution
And whenever I'm sad
You say it's not so bad
For every problem there's a Final Solution...

I think you're a nazi
Give me an answer, baby
Are you a nazi?
You drive a fuckin' panzer, baby

You say that love is blind
So how could I have guessed...
But then again, I met you
At the Wagner Fest...

I know you're a nazi
And that's why I'm leavin'
I know you're a nazi
Sure as my name is Stephen...
