[Chorus]
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

[Verse 1]
Racing all around the seven seas
Chasing all the girls and making robberies
Causing panic everywhere they go
Party-hardy on Titanic

[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, 'till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex-appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor-song

[Chorus]
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

[Verse 2]
Sailorman, you really turn me on
Now the guys are gone, come let us get it on
Girls like me are pretty hard to find
So if you go, I'll kick your hiney

[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, 'till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex-appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor-song

[Chorus]
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

[Bridge]
Now, let's fight
Ha, that's not a knife, this is a knife

[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking, 'till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex-appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor-song

[Chorus]
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing we love you
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm king of the world
Wow, this was great
Yeah baby, you can sail my ship

[Outro]
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you
