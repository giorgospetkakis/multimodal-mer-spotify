I must say it was love from the start
When you gave me a tune to sing
But I guess you'll never know
'cause some things are meant
To stay unrevealed

I heard a song on the radio
And it was sung for your ears only

When you're lost though you know
All directions by heart
Take a look what's behind the scene
There are hills and trees to be climbed
When you know someone awaits your return
