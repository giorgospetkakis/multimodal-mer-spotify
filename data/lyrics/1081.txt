I was blinded by the lights I saw reflecting in their eyes
It blinded me from the sea of everybody's smiles
I was young at best so I though I'd test the night
I thought that we could leave before the lights fell down
I wasn't listening

Chorus:
So carry on young gentlemen
Well I have done all that I can
And I have done all that I'll stand for
Carry on young gentlemen
I have done all that I can
I have done all that I'll stand for

We left after dark, the sun had fallen for the moon
And all the moments raced, its going way too fast its way too soon
So I sat alone before a moment they came back
Now I'm stuck right here reeling in the slack now
From my previous nights

Chorus

Deliver me now from everything we should not do
It's so unpredictable, but still you know just what you're gonna do
And even the moments that fall flat
Something is different, even though its hard to mean that
I wasn't listening

Chorus

I'll stand for something, I'll stand for something
I will stand for something, yeah

So carry on young gentlemen
I have done all that I can
And I have done all that I'll stand for
I have done all that I'll stand for
