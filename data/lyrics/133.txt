I said, if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, wha me seh?

It's a pity, you already have a wife
And me done have a man inna mi life
Rude boy, it is a pity
I say, it is a pity, you already have yuh wife
And me have a one man inna mi life
Rude boy, it is a pity

I woulda like one of these mornings to wake up and find
Your face on a pillow lying right next to mine
I woulda cut out the partying and the smoking and the rum
And buss a extra wine and make we seal up a son

Well, every time mi fantasize, me see your lips, me see your eyes
Your trigger finger do something a lef the rude girl hypnotized
For you it's just a thing, just another little fling
But for me this is Heaven and the angel them a sing

It's a pity, you already have a wife
And me done have a man inna mi life
Rude boy, it's such a pity, yo

I say, it is such a pity, you already have yuh wife
And me have a one man inna mi life
Rude boy, it is a pity

Fi buck you up inna public and can't even touch
It really fuck me up because me check fi you so much
The respect weh mi have fi your woman, fi your kids
Believe me rude boy mi criss, a nuh matey this

Who knows? Maybe one day the world will be evolved enough
We'll share you in a civilized manner between the two of us
But until then I woulda love see you again
Me know we have fi play it by the stupid rules of sin

I said, if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, wha me seh?

So meet me round the corner, avoid Mitzy and Lorna
You know them a two of the biggest informer
I'm not starving for sex no, nah bawl out vex no
But the way how yuh flex really beat my interest yo

Ayou weh people see a no the you fa me loving
And the you weh deh with me go much deeper than skin
I don't know exactly what it is you're feeling
But I wish this was a permanent thing, yo

It's such a pity, you already have yuh wife
And me done have a man inna mi life
Rude boy, it is a pity

I say, it is such a pity, you already have yuh wife
And me done a one man inna mi life
Rude boy, it is a pity

Me know seh you belong to she
You know seh me belong to him
Me wouldn't want you dis your queen
Me woulda never dis mi king

But when yuh play pon mi riddim
And when me feel your base a swing
You lef me inna turmoil, you have me head a spin

It really mek me sad fi haffi waste so much water
I think the two o' we can mek a beautiful daughter
But it would be selfish to an innocent little youth
Fi bring her come and cannot tell her the truth
Tell her the truth

I said, go with Jah, I will always love you
I said, if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, remember Tanya loves ya
