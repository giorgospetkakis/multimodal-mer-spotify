[Verse 1]
So there you are
Again, you're circling all around
If you could only touch me now
Stranger from the past
Don't hesitate, now we're standing face to face
If Heaven is the only place
Would you take my hand?

[Chorus]
Just tell me, "What do you want from me?"
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why, every time I feel your eyes all over me
Tell me, "What do you want from me?"
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line?
Come on now, set me free
What you want from me?

[Verse 2]
Get closer now
Softly whisper in my ear
Please take me away from here
Away from all my tears
It's not too late
Now we're standing face to face
And Heaven is the only place
Will you understand?

[Chorus]
Just tell me, "What do you want from me?"
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why, every time I feel your eyes all over me
Oh, tell me, "What do you want from me?"
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line?
Come on now, set me free

[Bridge]
And I know
If you give me this feeling, I'll be there to hold you tight (Ooh, oh)
'Cause I'd show, your love is a hero
We will run, run out of sight (What you want?)

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why every time I feel your eyes all over me
(What you want?)
