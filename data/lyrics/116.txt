[Verse 1]
Woke up one morning
Saw a rooster strutting by my house
Six pack rings 'round his neck, cock o' the block

[Refrain]
Don't stop now, don't stop now

[Verse 2]
What keeps Big Daddy happy?
What makes the buzzard buzz?
A leaky quart of motor oil, head for the hills

[Refrain]
Don't stop now, don't stop now

[Verse 3]
We pulled into Economy Island
King Shit and the Golden Boys
Plenty more where we come from, top o' the line

[Refrain]
Don't stop now, don't stop now
Don't stop now, don't stop now
Don't stop now, don't stop now
Donâ€™t stop now
