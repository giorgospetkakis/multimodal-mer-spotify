When you're overly confident
Then it's over before beginning the good part
Everybody fades away
Waves.. waves carrying them away
Wait.. wait
O'Malley, O'Malley, O'Malley..
O'Malley, O'Malley, O'Malley
Sing with me, sing with me, sing with me
Or I won't even sing

Hooray, hooray
O'Malley, run
Hooray, hooray
O'Malley, fun
Used to be the underdog
Hooray, O'Malley, run
But you're overly confident
So it's over before beginning the good part
Everybody fades away;
We got carried away
