Let me lie on grasses green
On my mother earth I lean

Let me lie on grasses green
On my mother earth I lean

Under burning sun
Through my veins she runs

Let me breathe the forest air
It's the life force that we all share
Feel my burning tears

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Let me lie on grasses green
On my mother earth I lean
Under burning sun
Through my veins she runs

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Let me lie on grasses green
On my mother earth I lean
Under burning sun
Through my veins she runs

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Heal me through as I lie
Here with you
Heal me through
Let me sleep and keep me close

Under burning sun
Through my veins she runs
Her and I are one
