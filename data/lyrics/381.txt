She was here with me today
Walking softly holding hands
And I thought I heard her say
She loved me

As we walked I felt her eyes
Reaching deeply into mine
And I thought I heard her sigh
She loved me

And along the way we shared a thought or two
It seemed as if I knew her well
Then she leaned to me and as we gently kissed
I knew that moment my heart fell

She was here

Now I'm lost in wondering
As if waking suddenly
Was it real or just a dream
Where is she?

Was she really here today?
Or was I just drifting back
To the times I heard her say
She loved me

Was she really here today?
She loved me
She loved me
