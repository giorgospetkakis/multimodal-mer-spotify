[Intro]
There’s a place that we can go
At the end of a long slow day
Streetlamps fuse the rising night
I feel so far away

[Verse 1]
When you came back late, from the garden
I couldn’t turn my eyes
And I was dead

[Verse 2]
Outside in the crowded pines
Ships are sailing though the wood
Impossible

[Verse 3]
Leaving in the space between
The Hovis homes, the railway heath
Impossible

[Verse 4]
I can see my freedom but I need a little time
Your hair wet and your arms full
You were dead, you were alive

[Verse 5]
Looking in the heart of light
Looking into the silence
From those nights so frigid

[Verse 6]
They seemed hardly real
Through the last light on the plain
Roland to the dark tower came

[Outro]
