"1, 2, 3 - Go..."
Broken! Yeah, you've been living -
On the edge of a broken dream
Nothing! Yeah, that's the only thing -
You'll ever take away from me

I'm never gonna stop - Ain't never gonna drop
Ain't no different than it was before
So take some good advice
You better stop and think twice
'fore you take your first step out that door

If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
You had your chance to walk away
Live to see another day
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
You're gonna get knocked down

Aaaaah... Suffering! Yeah, that's -
The only thing here that's left for you
Nothing! Yeah, that's the only thing -
You're ever gonna fuckin' do

I'm never gonna stop - Ain't never gonna drop
Ain't no different than it was before
So take some good advice
You better stop and think twice
'fore you take your first step out that door

If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
You had your chance to walk away
Live to see another day
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
You're gonna get knocked down
You're gonna get knocked down

And now you've crossed that line
You must be out your mind... "Go"

If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
You had your chance to walk away
Live to see another day
If you wanna step up (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (Knocked down)
You're gonna get knocked down
You're gonna get knocked down (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
You're gonna get knocked down (Step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
