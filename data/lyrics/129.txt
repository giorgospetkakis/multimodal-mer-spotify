Love, love is strange
Lot of people take it for a game
Once you get it, you never wanna quit (no, no)
After you've had it (yeah, yeah), you're in an awful fix
Many people don't understand (no, no)
They think loving (yeah yeah) is money in the hand
Your sweet loving is better than a kiss (yeah, yeah)
When you leave me, sweet kisses I miss

(Silvia...)
Yes Mickey?
(How do you call your loverboy?)
Come 'ere loverboy!
(And if he doesnt answer?)
Oh, loverboy!
(And if he STILL doesnt answer?)
I simply say
Baby
Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

Baby
Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
