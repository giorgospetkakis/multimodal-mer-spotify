Don't say it's over
Cause that's the worst news I
Could hear I swear that I will
Do my best to be here
Just the way you like it
Even though its hard to hide
Push my feelings all aside
I will rearrange my plans and
Change for you

If I could go back
That's the first thing I would do
I swear that I would
Do my best to follow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A guarantee and not a promise
That I'll never let your love
Slip from my hands

If it's the beaches
If it's the beaches' sands you want
Then you will have them
If it's the mountains' bending rivers
Then you will have them
If it's the wish to run away
Then I will grant it
Take whatever you think of
While I go gas up the truck
Pack the old love letters up
We will read them when
We forget why we left here
