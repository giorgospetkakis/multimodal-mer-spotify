[Spoken Intro: Matt Sharp]
Yeah, check me
Woo!

[Verse 1]
When I look in the mirror, I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude staring back at me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Broken, beaten down (down), can't even get around
Without an old man cane, I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone (woo!)

[Verse 2]
Excuse the bitching, I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling, 'cause feeling is pain

[Pre-Chorus]
As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Screw this crap, I've had it! (I've had it!) I ain't no Mr. Cool
I'm a pig, I'm a dog, so 'scuse me if I drool

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene
Just need to admit that I want sugar in my tea
Hear me? Hear me? I want sugar in my tea!

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back
I wanna go back
