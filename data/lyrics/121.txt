[Verse 1]
We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Ah!

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
