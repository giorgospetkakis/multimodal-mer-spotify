Waking up in the city
What are we gonna do
Take a picnic to the park
Sing songs about the moon
I will bring the frisbee
I will bring the dog
We'll frolic in the pesticided grass beneath the smog
Don't gotta worry 'bout bee stings
Don't gotta worry 'bout ants
Now's the time to take off our shoes
And dance that cartoon dance
In the afternoon time
We will stroll downtown
Past messengers on bicycles
And men dressed up in gowns
If we should get tired, let's just take the bus
I hope that it's not crowded so we can sit up front
I can't even see them scrape the sky
Blurring the fashions whizzing by
Sun gets down in the evening
Lights start flashing on
The city swells with energy
The nightlife has begun
Kustle and bustle
So many sites to see
Endless excitement
Keeps me up 'till three
Don't wanna go to the movies
Who wants to sit inside
I didn't get on the guest list
Don't want to wait in line
Let's go eat pierogis at my favorite cafe
The waitress are grumpy and
Their English ain't so great
We'll talk ourselves in circles
Til the pancakes are all gone
Today's become tomorrow
I can see the pink of dawn
Oh, I'm getting tired, I'm oh so tired
I think it's time to retire
Time for bed
To rest my sleepy head
