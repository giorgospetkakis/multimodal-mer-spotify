Are you changing, are you changing, are you changing
Do you know it, do you feel it, do you know it
But you're waiting, why're you waiting, why're you waiting
Just do it, whatever it is
There are secrets, there are secrets, there are secrets
There are places, there are places, you can go to
They might tell you, yeah they'll tell you, that you shouldn't

Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is

And you're dancing, and you're looking kinda crazy
And your arms, are making little circles
There are reasons, there are reasons, you can find out

So do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Whatever it is, whatever it is

It's so quiet, it's so quiet, it's so quiet
And you're dreaming, and you're dreaming, and you're dreaming
I turn to you and say - awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
So wake up. And do it, whatever it is. Just do it, whatever it is
'cause awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
So wake up
Wake up
And do it. Whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
