I promise you better things from now on
I'm gonna love you like my own son
No more the me that you use to meet out here
At night I swear I swear

And I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you right there

Sometimes I fear these hands of mine
Let us never mention this again

And I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear

And I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood I swear
I'm gonna love you like my very own son
Like my very own blood
