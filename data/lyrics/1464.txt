Stay in the shade
Until you reach the grave
Hide from yourself
And see how you fade
You'll see how you fade

Love moves on
Life goes on
And while you don't
You'll stand all alone

You'll see how you fade
You'll see how you fade
You'll see how you fade
Move on
See how you fade
Move on
You'll see how you fade
