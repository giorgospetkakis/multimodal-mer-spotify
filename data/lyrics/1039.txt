[Chorus 1]
She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

[Verse]
She knows the world is just her stage
And so she'll never misbehave
She gives thanks for what they gave her
Man, they practically made her
Into a mmm

[Chorus 2]
She's the one that stumbles when she talks about
The seven foreign films that she's checked out
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm

[Chorus 1]
She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

[Chorus 2]
But she's the one that stumbles when she talks about
So maybe we shouldn't talk about
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm
