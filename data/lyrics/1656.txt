We ain't done anything, we get blamed
We are the innocent, we get framed
Lies get told about us, when we're in court
You know that justice is never sought

We're victims of society
Lie are told but no one sees
Victims of society
Can't you see they're after you and me

Read in the paper, see it on the news
Law and disorder is all the media choose
Only show the hooligans, only show the thugs
Makes for better telly, makes us look mugs
