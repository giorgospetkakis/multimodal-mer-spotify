I have been destroyed
By the perfection that is a life
See I'm moving soon
See my feet are already on the road

And if you know where I'm going
Don't tell a soul

I live all for this thing
That I heard someone sing
When you have no one
No one can hurt you

It was so easy to see
How fucking good it all could be

And if you know where I'm going
Don't tell a soul

I live all for this thing
That I heard someone sing
When you have no one
No one can hurt you
