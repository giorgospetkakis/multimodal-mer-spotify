Rain happens into my room at night
When there is so much time to miss you
Beautiful changes I've seen sometimes
The clouds changing into reindeer and flying
To places clear of sorrow

Walking around
You know I've had enough of this trouble
Following me high and low. Now it can go

Some boy I knew said, Hang on, stay gold
Before he left here for England
Beautiful changes I feel sometimes
In the middle of the late morning dishes
When You say I might do anything at all

Walking around
You know I've had enough of this trouble
Following me high and low. Now it can go
