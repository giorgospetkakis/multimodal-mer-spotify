A last-minute decision
Lay it all on the line
Glass-pipe recollections of Antichrist
The nominees all on fire

Cash money up front
We're all part of the scam
Dead stars at the end of the rope
A fake miracle to behold

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

Ninety-nine—99 knives
Ninety-nine—99
Ninety-nine knives inside

Separate the symptoms
From the real disease
A pale, ghostlike rendition of consequence
The irony covers the crime

Reenact trauma
A safe pattern to fuse
Preteens giving head in the back room
A family built on abuse

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

Ninety-nine—99 knives
Ninety-nine—99
Ninety-nine knives inside

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

No one gets out alive

Ninety-nine, ninety-nine (ninety-nine)
Ninety-nine knives inside (ninety-nine)
Ninety-nine, ninety-nine

Ninety-nine hopeless fucking useless empty ways to die
