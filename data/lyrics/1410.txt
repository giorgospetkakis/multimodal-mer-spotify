Every step takes a beat of your heart
Through a city that's falling apart
On a night that rises and clears
In a sky that's clouded by years
My anger is a form of madness
So I'd rather have hope than sadness
And you said something
You said something stupid like
Love steals us from loneliness
Happy birthday
Are you lonely yet?

I misplaced your face in the shape of a smile
On a night that could never surprise me
Don't tell me you're afraid of the past
It's only the future that didn't last
You're kidding yourself, kidding yourself
You're going nowhere and you're going there fast

And you said something
You said something stupid like
Love steals us from loneliness
Happy birthday
Are you lonely yet?

You said something
You said something stupid like
Love won't shield us from loneliness
Happy birthday

You said something
You said something stupid like
Love steals us from loneliness
Happy birthday
Are you lonely yet?
Are you lonely yet?
Are you lonely yet?
Are you lonely yet?
