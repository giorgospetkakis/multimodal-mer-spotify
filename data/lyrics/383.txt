I'm overjoyed, and in the sun
The second time this year
I'm on a plane at 30,000 feet
The only way from here is down
And that's ok with me
Cause I'm overjoyed, I'm ready for the...

Fall (x 3)
Cause I'm ready for the fall

There's no surprise I've been forced to learn
That bliss comes at a price
And here I am still minin' gold
From the soul I sold like a whore
The finger of blame is pointing at me
Cause I lit that flame, now it's burning me
But I'm overjoyed and it's no surprise
That I'm ready for the fall

Fall (x8) (That I'm ready for the fall)
Fall....
