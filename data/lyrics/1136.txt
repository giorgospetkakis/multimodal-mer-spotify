[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 1]
Shine on Vegas and Wall Street
Place your bets
Shine on the fishermen
With nothing in their nets
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies
Shine on science
With its tunnel vision
Shine on fertile farmland
Buried under subdivisions

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Oh, let your little light shine

[Verse 2]
Shine on the dazzling darkness
That restores us in deep sleep
Shine on what we throw away
And what we keep
Shine on Reverend Pearson
Who threw away
The vain old God
Kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven
And fresh plowed sod
Shine on good earth, good air, good water
And a safe place
For kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding
Half a mile away

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 3]
Shine on world-wide traffic jams
Honking day and night
Shine on another asshole
Passing on the right!
Shine on the red light runners
Busy talking on their cell phones
Shine on the Catholic Church
And the prisons that it owns
Shine on all the Churches
They all love less and less
Shine on a hopeful girl
In a dreamy dress

[Chorus]
Oh, let your little light shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your little light shine

[Verse 5]
Shine on good humor
Shine on good will
Shine on lousy leadership
Licensed to kill
Shine on dying soldiers
In patriotic pain
Shine on mass destruction
In some god's name!
Shine on the pioneers
Those seekers of mental health
Craving simplicity
They traveled inward
Past themselves

[Outro]
May all their little lights shine
May all their little lights shine
