(Jump on my pleasure pill? ......... Yes please, haha!)

[Verse 1]
I cannot sleep
There's too much noise in my head!
I cannot sleep
I want it here instead!

[Chorus 1]
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna look at your face in peace now
You will never miss
But I can't!

(Ha ha ha!)

[Verse 2]
I cannot keep
The shame that's clawed us out!
And I will not keep
Your shut up, shut up lies!

[Chorus 2]
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live in bliss, in peace now
You will never miss
But I can!

(Ha ha ha!)
