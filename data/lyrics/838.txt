Hear the sounds of footsteps coming
Wait behind the door
Darkness in your eyes is calling
Everything grows cold
The sun will shine through the window onto you
Walk is cold but
Summer's coming
Feel the wind
It breaks
I've come to seek the fate that waits me
Somewhere in your face
The sun will shine through the window onto you
Oh Nadine
There's a message I will bring
To Nadine
Through the door I hear you sing
Your song
Please just tell me that it
Hasn't gone too far
For you
