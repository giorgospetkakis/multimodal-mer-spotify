[Verse 1]
I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my baby was just getting right
All systems on overload
Radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
And we were snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

[Verse 2]
You can wine and dine with a man all night
With good intent
But there is something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

[Bridge]
There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer
And start things happen again
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Zero visibility, yeah
Steamy windows
