Lately I find that you know me
Better than I know myself
Like a woman who's lost herself
By the water's edge
Her reflection was taken
By the tide

I just want you around
I want you around

Seconds and hours pass slowly
I move them all by myself
I can feel that I'm aging
My hair is turning black
There's a rythm behind it
That you can't know

Still, I want you around
I just want you around
'Cause I'm more lost than found

Shine a light on my misery
Wake the child from her sleep
Wipe the eyes of the dewy morning
The waters so deep

Still, I want you around
I want you around
I just want you around
