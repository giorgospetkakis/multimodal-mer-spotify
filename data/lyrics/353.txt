My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

Don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay with me, Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

[Break]

Baby, don't change your hair for me

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you...baby, are you smart?

Don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, why don't you stay with me, baby
And each day is Valentine's Day
Doo, wee, day
Every day is...
Every night is...
Every day, ooh, ooh...
