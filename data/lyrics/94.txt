[Verse 1]
You were right, I was up all night thinking about you
Dreamed I choked on your kaleidoscope
Now you still look deadly
My fatal flower how the tigers all laughed
As I ran along the well worn paths

[Chorus]
Sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

[Verse 2]
Insincere as we rolled for years in turning barrels
I washed my hands in the lake
As you blew it all away with roman candles
So take your fever, let me wallow alone
The callus on your eyes have grown

[Chorus]
Sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

[Verse 3]
And your faults have me stoned
Paying rent to your ghost
Torn up by a frightened little girl
I thought that you were right
So I was up all night thinking about you

[Bridge]
I thought that you were right, you were right
You were right, you were

[Verse 4]
You were right, and I was up all night thinking about you
And I couldn't speak
Covered with bees you flew above me
Figured it all out, I think you've had enough time
I've had long enough to change my mind

[Chorus]
And a sapphire eye looks down on my lilacs
Down on my lilacs, down on my lilacs
Down on me, down on me, down on

[Verse 3]
And your faults have me stone
Paying rent to your ghost
Torn up by a frightened little girl
I thought that you were right
And I was up all night thinking about you

[Outro]
You were right, so I was up all night
Thinking about you
I thought you were right, you were right
You were right, you were
