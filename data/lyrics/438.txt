Sinister, in a state of hope, summer night bring me cold
Someway I let it happen, in a flash, in a flash
Star of hope shining out there
So the night brought all cold
When all I want, all i want, is a state of hope, with all I want
Summer night, and I did not hope, for something I couldn't have. You turn me down, let it happen, with your hands, with your hands
Someway I let it happen, in a flash, in a flash, when all I want I want , is a state of hope
When all I want is a state of hope
