Come dry me out
Cause I've been drinking all night
Before I pass out I need your ghost to tell me this bloodless voice
Is as meaningless as it sounds
Hard fought for some spare time
To sit around and search for something I ain't never gonna find
Colors fade in the night sky
Lightning bugs are flashing on the front porch
No it's in my head
To take me back to another time
Cause once its gone it's just something you ain't never gonna find
No matter how hard you try
There's no reason to stop it
And you couldn't if you wanted now
Come dry me out
Just not with your fist
I'm not looking for a fight
Hard fought for some spare time
To search through books and records
For something you ain't never gonna find
If you could just make up your mind
Train tracks
Can't decide
Tennessee morning leaves you paralyzed
