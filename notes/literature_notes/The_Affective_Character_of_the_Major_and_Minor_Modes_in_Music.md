# The Affective Character of the Major and Minor Modes in Music

## Notes
- Established belief that there is a difference in affective qualities between major and minor modes in music:
    - Major: dynamic, upward force, positive emotions
    - Minor: passive, downward weight, relaxing, negative emotions
- Hard to investigate the role of mode on listener mood as it is influenced by a number of factors in music (tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, intensity, the situational context of the sequence)
    - Previous experiments have not been able to conclusively say whether the established beliefs about mode characteristics
    - One experiment suggested that changing intensity could "almost completely" mask the historical effects of the two modes
        - Louder chords are rarely relaxing; soft chords are often soothing
        - Upper pitch chords lead to more major responses; lower pitch chords lead to more minor ones
    - Hevner criticizes the conclusion that given reactions to modes are only learned behavior:
        - Study only used chords --> cannot be regarded as music; existing ideas are based on the use of modes in compositions
        - Expressiveness of a mood effect takes more than a moment to be comprehended --> quick switch between different attitudes in the form of different chords would not allow for properly sensing a mood
        - Some of the effect of modes depend on the switch between the two --> cannot be experienced in individual chords that only exist in one mode
- Goal of the present experiment is to address methodological flaws of previous ones

### Hypothesis/research question
- Are the accepted characteristics of major and minor modes apparent to listeners?
- Does recognition depend on mausic training/intelligence/talent?

### Method
- Stimuli: 10 pairs of short compositions differing only in mode (same tempo, rhythm, intensity)
- Mix of different types of compositions (sonatas, folk songs, etc.)
- Some originally written in major mode, some originally in minor
- 205 participants across 4 groups
- Each participant heard 5 major and 5 minor compositions (none of them from the same pair)
- During and immediately after listening to a composition, participants checked off all adjectives on a given list that they thought applied to a given piece
- After this, all 10 compositions were played again and participants had to check one adjective from pairs of opposite words that they felt best described the composition as well as indicate if they thought rhythm, tempo, harmony or melody was most important in giving the piece its character, if they thought the piece seemed familiar and to indicate the composer or title if they could
- Votes are tallied to indicate which adjectives participants associate with major compositions and which they associate with minor ones
- Both the ratio of votes for a given adjective and the total number of votes for each are considered to determine significance

### Findings
- Hevner's results indicated that the historical understanding of the characteristics of the two modes held true when all other musical features were held constant (words such as "happy" and "cheerful" were associated with major pieces and "melancholy" and "sad" with minor ones)
    - Furthermore, there was no substantial difference in how highly trained/talented/intelligent participants did compared to the low group
    - Training helps discriminate, but the lack of training (as well as intelligence and talent) does not remove the ability to discriminate established meanings for the two modes

## Potential usefulness
- Evidence for consistency in how listeners experience music moods according to mode --> we can look for patterns in our data and use this for literature review/basis/support/refutal of claims
